Lobular carcinoma: This starts in the lobules. Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue, increasing the chance of spreading to other parts of the body.

But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection.

            "System Response: Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases.\n",

These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents.

The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller).

Guided by imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI), cryoablation inserts a special freezing probe (a type of catheter) through the skin and to the tumor to be treated. Once the tip of the probe is in the right spot inside the tumor core, pressurized argon gas is injected through the probe into the tumor, freezing and destroying the cancerous tissue. Cryoablation techniques may vary from one cancer treatment facility to another. Cryoablation is more common in cases where the breast cancer is being well controlled by systemic treatments.\n",

[1] Many plant species in fire-affected environments require fire to germinate, establish, or to reproduce. Wildfire suppression not only eliminates these species, but also the animals that depend upon them. [2]Campaigns in the United States have historically molded public opinion to believe that wildfires are always harmful to nature. This view is based on the outdated belief that ecosystems progress toward an equilibrium and that any disturbance, such as fire, disrupts the harmony of nature. More recent ecological research has shown, however, that fire is an integral component in the function and biodiversity of many natural habitats, and that the organisms within these communities have adapted to withstand, and even to exploit, natural wildfire.\n",

Soil that is low in carbon will not support plant life and is susceptible to desertification. Without plants, soil cannot hold water sufficiently, and will become dry and brittle over time. Agroecology is an overarching category of approaches to creating a more sustainable agricultural system and increase the health of soil. It includes \"permaculture\", originally being a combination of the words \"permanent\" and \"agriculture\", which is a systems thinking approach that can increase the carbon content of soil by using natural patterns in already existing ecosystems to promote a higher efficiency of food production, a lower need for human involvement, and a healthier ecosystem.\n",

Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common.

Another pet will require time, energy, expense and patience. Many people who do not have enough time for one pet think that two will be better because they will keep each other company. If you think a second pet will help alleviate loneliness, boredom or behavior problems with your resident pet, think again. If you don't have time to spend with one cat, you surely will not have time to spend with two. Many cat owners end up with two bored and misbehaving pets instead of one. Furthermore, a second pet will not necessarily provide your cat with the companionship you have in mind. If you are willing to put in the time, patience and expense of a second pet, then take a look at your cat's desires.\n",

February 21, 2017 By Crazy Cat Lady Mar 0 Comments Did you ever try to have a staring contest with your cat only to have them blink slowly at you and then avert their eye? It is a very curious sort of behavior with a definite meaning. Directly staring at your cat can be interpreted as an aggressive behavior. This is because cats use this stare in the wild to threaten or challenge. Cats that have a friendly relationship will rarely look each other in the eyes. If they do, then they typically blink and then look away. This is their way of saying there is no threat and the relationship is one of friendship and peace. When a cat does the same to their owner it is their way of saying I do not perceive you as a threat but am comfortable with our relationship. It can also be a means of asking for further interaction. When your cat does the slow blink see if they are asking for more.\n",

Cow Milk No matter where you are on the planet, you’ve almost certainly come across cow milk. In most parts of the world, it is the primary [ 1] animal milk consumed by humans, although goat, sheep, and even camel milk are popular based on the availability of animals. Cow milk (derived from bovines) is intended for sucking by young cows, just as human infants are often nursed with human breast milk. However, the nutritional value and availability of cow’s milk have made it one of the most in-demand liquids on the planet. More than 6 billion people on the planet drink milk on a semi-regular basis, which means that these animals are an incredibly important part of our global nutritional needs.\n",

Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol.

Sure, full-fat dairy products taste better than the skim/fat-free versions, but I don’t eat them for the taste. I eat full-fat dairy because it’s better for my health and my weight. Yep, you heard me right: I eat dairy products with all the fat god gave ‘em, and I do it because it’s good for me. Here’s why:1. Our bodies cannot digest the protein or absorb the calcium from milk without the fat. Love This? Never Miss Another Story.2. Vitamins A and D are also fat-soluble. So you can’t absorb them from milk when all the fat has been skimmed off. (This makes fortified skim milk the biggest sham of all — you can pump fat-free milk full of a year’s supply of vitamins A and D, but the body can’t access them).3.\n",

Someone may owe you money To find out, researchers from Mc Gill University recently conducted an experiment, published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology, to determine the nutritional value of plant-based milk beverages. To do so, they compared the health benefits of the four most popular alternative milks, including soy, almond, coconut and rice. They examined the number of calories and amount of protein, fat and carbohydrates found in each. They also looked into the vitamins and minerals the substitutes contained. While they said cow’s milk still has the most nutritional value, with 8 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat and 11.5 grams of carbs, soy is the most comparable for overall balance. It’s “a clear winner,” they wrote in a statement. It has more protein than all the other milk options analyzed, with 7 to 12 grams and 95 calories a glass.\n",

            "System Response: Soy milk maker A soy milk maker is a small kitchen appliance which automatically cooks soy milk, a non-dairy beverage made from soy beans. Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker. Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages. Homemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value. Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products. Ordinary methods for making soy milk at home are often very labor-intensive (requiring beans to be soaked, ground in a blender, strained, and then cooked). Soy milk machines perform many of these steps automatically, greatly simplifying home-based soy milk production. Section::::Standard operation.

            "System Response: Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (\"Avena spp.\") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

It is hearty, rich and creamy. Soy milk is good for drinking straight from the glass, poured over cereal or in coffee. The taste is nutty and slightly sweet. When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow’s milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job. That means that soy milk is also the best choice when making vegan buttermilk for Vegan Buttermilk Biscuits or for dredging to make breaded dishes like “Chicken-Fried” Tofu Steaks.\n",

I'm aware that over use of soy in food products may be a health concern to many readers as of this writing due to some health studies that have been published. In vegan baking we're using so little of it that if you're concerned about it you really shouldn't be eating baked items in the first place because the sugar and glycemic index issues are a much more serious health issue.

In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids.\n",

He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying \"It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?\". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983.

With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory. Following this event, the US Congress decided to place anabolic steroids under the list of Controlled Substances. Within no time, the drug was included among the other drugs under the Controlled Substances Act.\n",

Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene.\n",

[Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors.\n",

June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system.\n",

The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you “turn off” the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene.

Heme irons are absent in the plant foods.• Foods rich in heme-iron can improve the absorption of non-heme iron.• The most abundant dietary iron is non-heme iron. Normally, 60% of non-heme iron is present in animal products. The remaining 40% is heme iron.• Dietary non-heme iron is present as ferric iron (Fe III), and it has to be reduced to ferrous iron (Fe II) in order to be absorbed.• Unlike non-heme iron, heme iron is associated with hemoglobin and myoglobin in the form of ferrous (Fe II) iron.\n",

Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein.

However, the authors note that these figures likely underestimate the extent of stigma associated with mental illness since they only evaluated data on anxiety and mood disorders. (13)Finally, presenting mental health care services in culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to increasing access to and usage of mental health care services, as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical perspective on mental illness. For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes toward mental illness surveyed students at a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The Indian students were more likely to view depression as arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation” as ways to deal with depression.\n",

The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others.\n",

Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that \"traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures\".

Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness.

In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns.

In a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a vignette in which an individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded that the individual’s illness was “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants were asked to rate how they would feel if one of their children dated, married, or reproduced with the subject of the vignette. Genetic attribution of mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce among Chinese Americans, but it increased the same measures among European Americans, supporting previous findings of cultural variations in patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)Many studies have reported other significant differences in attitudes towards mental illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song et al.

It spreads unjustified fears about the mentally ill and worsens the stigma around it.\" The 2018 FBI study found that shooters typically experienced several stressors in the year before they attack: financial pressures, fights with classmates or co-workers, and substance abuse.

To address both, Chibanda stripped mental health care down to basic human connection. He removed the medical and technical elements that made seeking treatment intimidating, and developed a simple solution to enlist the help of lay health workers who could take on matriarchal roles. He first called the meeting spots “mental health benches,” but that was too stigmatizing, so he gave them a more inviting name: “Friendship Benches.” The grandmothers are trained in what is essentially the Western model of cognitive behavioral therapy, but they use indigenous terms that their “patients” can more easily relate to.

And the treatment is continuous. After the patients have done several sessions with the grandmothers, they are often referred to peer support groups where they might learn a skill together, like how to weave bags with recycled plastic. “It’s a powerful way of keeping that link with the grandmothers,” Chibanda said in an interview. “Human contact, which is often overlooked when we prescribe medication, can be equally as effective for mild to moderate depression. I fell in love with the whole idea of sitting down with people and being able to uplift a person, talk them through and out of depression through all of these evidence-based practices.” In Zimbabwe, the ratio of traditional mental health professionals to the population in need is an extreme example of a global problem affecting both the developing and developed world.\n",

In many European vernacular literatures, Christian poetry appears among the earliest monuments of those literatures, and Biblical paraphrases in verse often precede Bible translations. In Old English poetry, the \"Dream of the Rood\", a meditation on Christ's crucifixion which adapts Germanic heroic imagery and applies it to Jesus, is one of the earliest extant monuments of Old English literature. Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\" represents one of the earliest monuments of Italian vernacular literature. Much Old Irish poetry was the work of Irish monks and is on religious themes. This story is repeated in most European languages. Modern Christian poetry especially suffers from a difficulty of definition.

The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide allegory. Section::::Overview of Christian poetry. Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins. The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament. Canticles such as the \"Magnificat\" and \"Nunc Dimittis\", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models. Many Biblical scholars also believe that St Paul of Tarsus quotes bits of early Christian hymns in his epistles. Passages such as Philippians 2:5-11 (following) are thought by many Biblical scholars to represent early Christian hymns that were being quoted by the Apostle: Within the world of classical antiquity, Christian poets often struggled with their relationship to the existing traditions of Greek and Latin poetry, which were of course heavily influenced by paganism.\n",

Other Christian poems of the late Roman Empire, such as the \"Psychomachia\" of Prudentius, cut back on allusions to Greek mythology, but continue the use of inherited classical forms. Other early Christian poets were more innovative. The hymnodist Venantius Fortunatus wrote a number of important poems that are still used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, such as the \"Vexilla Regis\" (\"The Royal Standard\") and \"Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis\" (\"Sing, O my tongue, of the glorious struggle\").

Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers to Mecca (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the quasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran. Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the “Age of Ignorance”. This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran. Islamic poetry is very important and it is a heritage passed from generation to generation. These poems and features examine Muslim faith and Islamic culture and address important events, holidays, and occasions such as Ramadan. These poets explore a range of spiritual, literary, and political concerns from the 6th century to the present day. Also, Islamic poetry was found centuries ago.\n",

            "System Response: The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar), which ensured a rhythm. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call- and-response performance.\n",

            "Turn 6: Why didn't it use rhymes as much?\n",
            "System Response: Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages. Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line. The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was \"parallelism\", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences.\n",

In some cases the rhymed prose is a distinctive, well-defined style of writing. In modern literary traditions the boundaries of poetry are very broad (free verse, prose poetry, etc.), and some works may be described both as prose and poetry.

It influenced other cultures of the Muslim world, such as Persian (as exemplified by Saadi's \"Gulestan\") and Turkish (). \"Maqama\" also influenced the medieval Hebrew literature, a significant amount of which was produced by Jews of the Muslim world. It influenced the style of Yehuda Alharizi, Ibn Zabara, Ibn Hasdai (Abraham ben Samuel ha-Levi ibn Hasdai), Ibn Sahula, Jacob ben Eleazer.

            "System Response: Modern Hebrew poetry Modern Hebrew poetry is poetry written in the Hebrew language. It was pioneered by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, and it was developed by the Haskalah movements, that saw poetry as the most quality genre for Hebrew writing. The first Haskalah poet, who heavily influenced the later poets, was Naphtali Hirz Wessely, at the end of the 18th Century, and after him came Shalom HaCohen, Max Letteris, Abraham Dob Bär Lebensohn, his son Micah Joseph, Judah Leib Gordon and others. Haskalah poetry was greatly influenced by the contemporary European poetry, as well as the poetry of the previous ages, especially Biblical poetry and pastoralism. It was mostly a didactic form of poetry, and dealt with the world, the public, and contemporary trends, but not the individual. A secular Galician Jew, Naftali Herz Imber, wrote the lyrics to HaTikva in 1878; this later became the national anthem of Israel. In the age after the Haskalah, many prominent poets were associated with Hovevei Zion.

Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest. Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States. At their core, the protests carry the same message: A country that allows state security agents to kill and abuse people with impunity is not a mature democracy. And, as in the United States, this is not the first time Nigerians have risen up against police brutality. Amnesty International documented at least 82 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, extortion and rape by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020.\n",

Nothing happened. “You kind of give up on these things,” Olaitan said. SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter. Temi Afolabi, a lawyer in Lagos, said officers have a reputation for searching phones at random and detaining people for outrageous reasons.\n",

The Nigerian Police Force said it has fired at least two officers since the demonstrations began and has said it would probe past atrocities with the help of civil society leaders. Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of the squad’s abuses in the past three years, including beating, hanging, mock execution, sexual assault and waterboarding. In Lagos, chaos escalated on Tuesday following news reports that officers had killed two people. A crowd torched a police station, and protesters blocked roads. Police deployed anti-riot officers to “protect the lives and property of all Nigerians and secure critical national infrastructure across the country,” the department said in a statement. The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people.\n",

International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts.\n",

In the two weeks since Nigerians began flooding the streets to rally against a police unit widely viewed as abusive, overseas megastars such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Cardi B and Drake have thrown their fame behind the cause. Now the protest is dominating social media feeds on practically every continent and, by Wednesday, had made its way into the U.S. presidential race. “The United States must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,” Democratic nominee Joe Biden said in a statement. Attention to the movement skyrocketed after Tuesday night, when protesters and human rights groups say Nigerian soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Lagos, a metropolis of approximately 20 million. “There was no warning,” one protester told The Washington Post, like others speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution.\n",

            "System Response: As Human Rights Watch’s Sarah Margon notes, any action to assist the Nigerian army is fraught with moral hazard; this is an army that is responsible for almost as many abuses against civilians in northeastern Nigeria as Boko Haram itself. There are few alternatives to doing so, however. The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves.\n",

The movement has also inspired solidarity protests in major cities of the world, including London, New York, Berlin and Washington. Women play a leading role in the ongoing #EndSARS movement against police brutality and government violence in Nigeria, specifically seeking to abolish a federal police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. One nascent women’s group in particular, the Feminist Coalition, has used digital platforms to mobilize funds and design strategies to support protesters across Nigeria. The Feminist Coalition’s work in the #EndSARS movement continues a long history of women leading and supporting political mobilizations across Africa. This engagement, however, has typically been minimized or ignored outright in the retelling of the events. Here’s what you need to know. Who are the Feminist Coalition?

It raised and managed funds for the movement, established a legal aid service made up of volunteers, and coordinated help lines to align efforts across the country.

The online mobilization effort has garnered global support, generating over 28 million tweets within 48 hours of the online campaign’s kickoff on Oct. 8.

These technologies also helped the #EndSARS movement navigate the Nigerian government’s responses to the protests.

My book, “Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State,” examined an earlier movement focused on the protection of black lives. I studied archival materials of the battle by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923. My research showed how the NAACP raised public awareness, met with American presidents, secured the support of Members of Congress, and won a consequential criminal justice victory in the Supreme Court. Drawing from the book’s findings, we can identify three key things to know about ongoing #BlackLivesMatter protests: 1. The fight to protect black lives from unjust state violence has deep historical roots Some people, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, have expressed confusion as to why protesters believe recent police misconduct is emblematic of a system of racial injustice and not just a few bad apples. For many blacks, what is happening right now is not new; it is grounded in a documented history of state violence against black citizens.\n",

            "System Response: A typical type of a portfolio is one used by artists. An artist's portfolio consists of artwork that the artist can take to job interviews, conferences, galleries, and other networking opportunities to showcase his or her work, and give others an idea of what type of genre the artist works in. Art Portfolios, sometimes called \"artfolios\", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs. For instance, one portfolio may be mainly for doing technical illustrations and another may be for surreal painting or sculpture. Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills. Talent portfolios can also include video. Animators typically use demo reels, also known as \"demo tapes\", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers. Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works.\n",

There was our culprit. The shaking stopped. When an especially mean stray tick got on Jasmine's ear, her instinct was to shake her head. (Stray tick because it was one of the only two we ever found at the ranch.) The bite was painful for Jasmine though, so every time she started to shake her head she'd cry a little, stop and hold her head down, tilted towards the affected ear. This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully.

Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem.\n",

The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it.

This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used.

You can pet your dog, walk your dog and play with your dog without worry of contracting the virus from the animal. “If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets,” the CDC recommends. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is spread primarily when infected people cough and sneeze submicroscopic droplets onto smooth surfaces or onto other people. No special precautions need to be taken with the dog; just practice normal hygiene. Check with your veterinarian for more information. P.S.: It is not necessary for your dog to wear a mask over his nose and mouth, although it does make quite a picture to post!\n",

The case has raised the specter that dogs might be swept into the epidemic, which, even now, public health officials say does not appear to infect or be spread by pets. But experts say much remains unknown about the dog’s infection, and they emphasized the lone case is not yet cause for alarm or reassessments about interactions with pets. The dog is owned by a person who was hospitalized with covid-19, and it has been quarantined since Feb. 26, according to Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. The department said last week that the dog’s “weak positive” test results, from nasal and oral swabs, might have been the result of “environmental contamination,” not infection. But positive tests since then suggest the dog does have a low-level of infection, the department said Wednesday.\n",

The feline coronavirus can remain inactive and harmless in the home, but it is very easy to destroy the virus with regular cleaning habits. The feline coronavirus poses no threat to humans. How to Prevent the Feline Coronavirus and FIP While it is impossible to know which cats will develop the FIP condition after being infected with the coronavirus, there are several things pet owners can do to possibly prevent the coronavirus from occurring in the first place. Making sure your cat's healthy and has a strong immune system is important in preventing disease. Providing proper nutrition, exercise, and a low-stress environment is the best way to keep your pet healthy. Keeping cats overcrowded may increase stress, lower immunity, and may spread viruses easily, so it is best not to allow this to happen. Comments\n",

            "System Response: And as Steve Knopper’s excellent recent book, “MJ: The Genius of Michael Jackson,” suggests, that relationship was a great deal more complicated than any implication that Jackson wanted to be white. Jackson’s relationship to his skin was complicated from a young age, Knopper reports: The Jackson brothers teased each other mercilessly about their appearances. Michael’s nose was the source of his early nickname, as Jermaine’s acne was for him. The Jacksons had been subject to intense media scrutiny starting when they were very young and that meant Michael had to go through puberty in the public eye, a process that included media scrutiny of his blemishes. Nancy Leiviska, who worked with MTV, set Jermaine and Michael up with a dermatologist, and both Jacksons became vegetarians in an effort to fight acne through their diets. Michael would later have procedures to try to limit the appearance of his acne scars. Michael Jackson’s vexed relationship to his skin wasn’t only cosmetic, and it wasn’t only a response to media pressure.\n",

Later, Richard Strick, another dermatologist, “could see the disease had destroyed nose cartilage, which might have explained some of Michael’s plastic surgery.” That latter condition was one source of physical pain for Jackson; the next year would bring another. While filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984, Jackson was badly burned during the sixth take of the ad. He had to have skin grafts and balloons implanted in his scalp as part of his recovery. In an attempt to ease his ongoing discomfort, a plastic surgeon tried to eliminate some of Jackson’s scar tissue. “For this procedure, as well as Michael’s continuing struggles with discoid lupus and acne scarring— plus his continuing experiments with his nose, chin, and cheekbones— Klein and Debbie Rowe administered pain medication,” Knopper writes. “They were careful not to give too much, Rowe recalls.\n",

For twelve weeks, one group ate a diet that was 25 percent protein and 45 percent low-glycemic carbohydrates. The other group ate carbs without any control of glycemic index, resulting in a higher glycemic diet. At the end of the study, the acne had decreased in the low-glycemic group by almost twice the rate of the high-glycemic group! ( 17)As part of the protocol to treat acne from the inside out, it’s important eat foods that don’t cause blood sugar spikes or increased inflammation. Here are tips for following a acne-free diet: Focus on eating lots of leafy green vegetables, berries and clean protein. Increase consumption of wild fish, grass-fed meat and cage-free chickens.

In the short term, Pepsi made a $1.5million compensation payment, which Jackson donated to a Californian medical centre, who later named a burns treatment wing in his honour. Footage taken at the time reveals the harsh nature of the burn, with Jackson's scalp still glowing In the long term, it was this fateful day that was later cited as the turning point in Jackson's rollercoaster life. Although it was not discussed publicly for many years, it was later reported during the trial into Doctor Conrad Murray's involvement in his death, that Jackson had suffered so much from the burns that he became addicted to medication to ease the pain on his scalp, and to help him sleep.

            "System Response: According to the book, initially published last year in Britain, the singer was in such pain that he took Percocet, Darvocet and, during his subsequent scalp treatments, large amounts of Demerol, all of which kick-started decades of dependence on narcotics. That dependence, coupled with financial difficulties that would compel him to agree to a demanding string of performances in London in 2009, set the table for Jackson to become more reliant on Murray, a doctor facing his own money troubles. “Dr. Conrad Murray was not, nor ever would have been, suited to be the caretaker of a complicated patient like Michael Jackson,” the authors state. “And from the moment they met, their fate was sealed.” “83 Minutes” returns often to this idea that Jackson’s demise was inevitable, not only because of Murray’s negligence, but also because of previous doctors who accommodated Jackson’s desire for propofol and other drugs, and Jackson himself, who apparently considered himself immune to the risks. Even though followers of the Murray case and fans of Jackson may be aware of many of the details outlined in “83 Minutes,” revisiting all the pieces of the puzzle in a single volume has a powerful narrative effect.\n",

When Michael was on stage, he occasionally wore outfits that covered parts of his skin and wore make up. People thought this was just a stage gimmick but the fact was Michael had to conceal the white patches on his skin. During his performances Michael would appear on stage or on videos showing only some parts of his body that were not affected. Whenever he went out, he usually shielded himself from sunlight to protect his skin. As years past by, Michael’s skin just became lighter and lighter in color. The treatments that he underwent contributed to the discoloration of his skin. Michael only revealed his condition in 1993 during an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he had Vitiligo.

White, fragrant flowers have appeared, followed by cherry-like fruit, each containing two seeds: Arabica coffee beans, the most popular in the world. But last month, the worst drought in decades hit Brazil's coffee belt region, destroying crop yields and causing the price of coffee to shoot up by more than 50 percent so far this year. The drought is historic, with more than 140 cities in Brazil forced to ration water. The country's leading newspapers reported that some neighborhoods are receiving water only every three days. For now, retail prices for coffee are stable. Roasters typically have enough supplies to cover themselves for a few months.

Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry. The proposed reasons for the drought are plentiful.\n",

At issue is a fungus called coffee rust that has caused more than $1 billion in damage across the Latin American region. The fungus is especially deadly to Arabica coffee, the bean that makes up most high-end coffees. It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. But the government is not doing this just to protect $4-a-cup specialty coffees, much as Americans love them. The chief concern is about the economic security of small farms abroad.

The Global Cities Initiative, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and JPMorgan Chase, will oversee an in-depth study to help the area figure out how to boost exports to offset some of the economic pain caused by the slowdown in federal spending. A coalition of three regional organizations — representing government, businesses and universities — asked for the help by applying to join the initiative. They did so because the Washington area, despite including a major world capital, is near the bottom of the heap when it comes to doing business overseas. Among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Washington ranks 98th in the share of its economic activity fueled by exports, according to Brookings.

Of course, President Trump as a candidate famously released — in lieu of his physical — a letter from a doctor declaring that “if elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” — a letter it later emerged that Trump had dictated himself.\n",

            "System Response: Former president Jimmy Carter expressed doubt Tuesday night that he would have been able to handle the presidency at age 80, saying the job requires being “very flexible with your mind” and suggesting that there should be an age limit. Carter did not mention any of the current presidential candidates in his comments, but two leading Democratic contenders — former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — would turn 80 while in office if elected. Question’s about Biden’s age and mental acuity, in particular, have become part of the conversation in the Democratic nominating process. He is currently 76, while Sanders is 78. Carter, who turns 95 next month, was asked during an event at the Carter Center in Atlanta what it would take for him to run for president again. The questioner noted that Grover Cleveland had served two nonconsecutive terms in the late 19th century. “I hope there’s an age limit,” Carter said with a big grin as he sat next to his wife, Rosalynn Carter.\n",

            "System Response: It seems as though nearly everyone who has heard of CrossFit has an opinion about it — even people who have never tried it. Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it’s a fast track to injury. CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc. Rather than training people to become very good at a few exercises, CrossFit prompts them to do things that people do in real life, such as getting up and raising things off the ground, Berger says.\n",

Section::::Criticism.:Exertional rhabdomyolysis. The relationship between CrossFit and exertional rhabdomyolysis has been a subject of controversy for the company. Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision. CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis.

            "System Response: There’s a kind of dedication, a gleam in the eye that many don’t find in a weekly Zumba class. Many CrossFitters have embraced the criticism. A CrossFit box in Connecticut calls itself “CrossFit Religion” with the motto “In WOD we Trust,” referring to the Workout of the Day that is the foundation of the practice of CrossFit. But J.C. Herz, author of “Learning to Breathe Fire: The Rise of CrossFit and the Primal Future of Fitness,” says that she would class CrossFit as “spiritual but not religious,” similar to yoga. But while many yoga instructors tend to focus more on calming the mind and body, Herz says that CrossFit is spiritual in that every workout asks you to dig deeply. In an age where many are opting out of organized religion, CrossFit provides a rare place of community and holistic transformation. It may not be religious institutionally, but CrossFit does a better job than many religious communities in transforming people’s lives. It may seem strange for what is essentially a fitness program, but CrossFit involves an identity shift that carries over into life well beyond the gym.\n",

To borrow a famous phrase, you could do chronic Crossfit just as easily as chronic cardio – and it would be just as dangerous. But it’s time to separate cardio from the “more is better” philosophy. More is not better, but there’s a way to enjoy cardiovascular exercise without compromising your recovery or health!Again, this doesn’t mean that cardio is healthy for everyone, or that it’s required for physical fitness. Every person has a different body type, and different body types are naturally better suited to different exercises. Some people do not do well with cardio, and that’s perfectly fine: just don’t do it.

            "System Response: Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder.

Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4.

It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average. It requires less time (and potentially less money). Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals. Instead of stopping what you’re doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice. Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two.

            "System Response: When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive.

The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive.

            "System Response: This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle.\n",

They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes.

Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived.

Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters.\n",

Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found. It has been described as having been as tall as 52 feet and as eating herbs, leaves and fruits from the tops of trees. It is described as having existed as long ago as 156 million years and becoming extinct by 145 million years ago.

During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago.

At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the \"\"K-T boundary\"\", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the \"\"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction\"\". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called \"\"theories\"\", however in this case \"\"hypotheses\"\" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as \"\"hypothesis\"\" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence).\n",

Geography and Climate During the Jurrasic Period The Jurassic period witnessed the breakup of the Pangaean supercontinent into two big pieces, Gondwana in the south (corresponding to modern-day Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica) and Laurasia in the north (Eurasia and North America). At about the same time, intra-continental lakes and rivers formed that opened new evolutionary niches for aquatic and terrestrial life. The climate was hot and humid, with steady rainfall, ideal conditions for the explosive spread of lush, green plants. Terrestrial Life During the Jurassic Period Dinosaurs: During the Jurassic period, relatives of the small, quadrupedal, plant-eating prosauropods of the Triassic period gradually evolved into multi-ton sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. This period also saw the concurrent rise of medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Megalosaurus. This helps explain the evolution of the earliest, armor-bearing ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. Mammals: The mouse-sized early mammals of the Jurassic period, only recently evolved from their Triassic ancestors, kept a low profile, scurrying around at night or nesting high up in trees so as not to get squashed under the feet of bigger dinosaurs.\n",

At 7mm (0.27 inches) long, Paedophryne amauensis may be the world's smallest vertebrate - the group that includes mammals, fish, birds and amphibians. The researchers also found a slightly larger relative, Paedophryne swiftorum. Presenting the new species in PLo S One journal, they suggest the frogs' tiny scale is linked to their habitat, in leaf litter on the forest floor. What are amphibians?

Tiny Frogs Hard to Catch Discovered in 2010 but announced on Wednesday, all the species of the Paedophyrne genus are tiny and seem to live solely amid leaf litter on New Guinea's rain forest floor. Scientists locate the teensy animals by listening for their calls and trying to zero in on the sources of the sounds—no mean feat, since the high pitch of the calls make their sources especially hard for human hearing to locate.

People shuffled into the plentiful limoncello shops and gathered on the steep staircase leading to the Duomo di Sant’ Andrea, the 9th-century Romanesque cathedral that stands at the heart of the town. Keeping a watchful eye over the plaza were an elderly couple, high on their top-floor balcony. Wrapped in snug dressing gowns, the pair surveyed the scene in silence. Amalfi’s surge in popularity began in Edwardian times, when wealthy families from across Europe deemed it a pleasant place to spend their winters. By the 1950s, it had gained a reputation for glamour and sophistication. Today, it attracts travelers in search of fine food, eye-popping scenery and weather that’s nothing short of sublime.

            "System Response: A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located. All cathedrals, including the Duomo Cathedral of Florence, are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. The long arms running from west to east are called the nave, and the shorter ones from north to south are the transept. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing. Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other. Sometimes this meant war, but usually the competitions were simply designed to embarrass the other or prove that one city was the richest and most powerful in the area. One popular way to do this was by constructing massive buildings that required lots of money, manpower, and technological innovation.\n",

            "System Response: Because the Duomo of Florence was meant to emphasize size, the inside crossing was 140 feet wide. This was entirely new for churches and made the inside feel extremely spacious. Although the entire cathedral is incredible, the most famous architectural feature is the dome, called the cupola in Italian. Around 1417, the building commission awarded Filippo Brunelleschi and Lorenzo Ghiberti the task of building a dome on the top of the cathedral. Ghiberti ended up dropping out of the project because he was working on another part of the cathedral. Brunelleschi was facing a monumental task. The area that the dome had to cover, the 140-foot crossing, was so big that nobody knew how to build a dome that wouldn't be so heavy it would collapse. After lots of mathematical calculations, Brunelleschi decided to build a dome with a slight point, rather than a smooth, round top. This style, called ogival, helped reduce the pressure of the structure and made the base of the dome responsible for supporting its weight, which made it stronger.\n",

Some cities offer financial incentives for using rainwater for irrigation as a supplement to municipal water. Caution Check for restrictions on rain barrels and rain harvesting in your area. You may need a permit in some locations, or the use of rain barrels may be prohibited or governed by state, local or neighborhood regulations. Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternatives for dispensing the water are a garden hose, soaker hose or watering can. Estimate how much rainwater you'll capture. Collection rates vary depending on the slope and size of the roof, but for estimation purposes, during a 1-inch rainfall you can collect a little over half a gallon for each square foot of roof.\n",

The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof).\n",

            "System Response: By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult). The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it.\n",

            "System Response: This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible.\n",

The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65.

While the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still says that \"\"no amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy,\"\" the New York Post reports that a 2009 study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children whose mothers had one or two drinks per week while pregnant did not have an increased risk of cognitive defects compared to those who had no alcohol.

At the heart of this debate is the research itself. So, what do we actually know about light drinking during pregnancy? Let’s start with alcohol and the risk of miscarriage. Light drinking, the equivalent of 1-2 drinks per week, during the first trimester, boosts the odds of a first trimester miscarriage by about 30%, and the odds of a early second trimester miscarriage (between 13-16 weeks) by about 70%, according to a large study of over 90,000 pregnancies in Denmark.

The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you. What’s best for you is to not drink at all,” she said.\n",

The best treatment for you will depend on your personal preference, your age, whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding and any medical conditions you have. Speak to your GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser for advice. Research has shown that all these methods can be effective. Importantly, evidence shows that they are most effective if used alongside support from an NHS stop smoking service. The treatments available are outlined below. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine. NRT is a medication that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke. It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking.\n",

            "System Response: It’s important for us to be able to advise people what level of consumption is safe.” As for the threshold for low-risk drinking, White said, “there’s no magic number here. The effects of alcohol on health are very complicated. The effects are influenced by a wide range of factors, like body weight and sex, medications, rate of consumption, so it’s very hard to arrive at one single threshold below which everybody’s going to be safe from harm.” The new research does not suggest that a drinker who has just a little too much every day is falling off an epidemiological cliff. Instead, a little bit too much causes a little lower life expectancy. But as the drinker ventures further beyond the threshold, the life expectancy continues to erode in dramatic fashion. Wood and her colleagues found that the threshold for health risks is 100 grams per week (about the alcohol in seven standard American beers, though craft beers have higher alcohol content). The drop in life expectancy for a 40-year-old who drinks between 100 and 200 grams is six months, on average, compared with someone who drinks between zero and 100 grams, the study found.\n",

Many experts believe that an imbalance among the different neurotransmitters is the cause of depression. Although the exact mechanism of action of trazodone is unknown, it probably improves symptoms of depression by inhibiting the uptake of serotonin by nerves in the brain. This results in more serotonin to stimulate other nerves. Trazodone also may increase directly the action of serotonin.\n",

In the brain, this neurotransmitter acts as a relay, transporting messages from one area to another. Given this critical task, an imbalance in serotonin levels may influence our emotions. Since depression is often characterized by negative emotions, the link between this mood disorder and serotonin is obvious.

            "System Response: So the way to increase central nervous system neurotransmitter levels is to provide proper amounts of the amino acid precursor. Bananas, especially ripe bananas, are an exceptional food for regulating dopamine because they have a high concentration of tyrosine. Other foods that increase dopamine through the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine include almonds, apples, watermelons, cherries, yogurt, beans, eggs and meats. It is important to note that dopamine foods alone generally do not have the therapeutic amino acid levels necessary to boost dopamine levels for someone experiencing major depressive disorder.

Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine. Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues. Section::::Structure.

The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment.

Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3.

In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice.\n",

            "Turn 6: How many years will it take to recoup the investment?\n",
            "System Response: Even with this significant front-end investment, geothermal systems are so energy-stingy that the payback period is remarkably brief. A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. \"\"It's a win-win arrangement,\"\" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities.\n",

            "\n",
            "Turn 7: That’s great. What makes it so efficient?\n",
            "System Response: It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium.\n",

            "Turn 8: Cool science. But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones.\n",
            "System Response: If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement.\n",

            "\n",
            "Turn 9: Tell me about AC systems.\n",
            "System Response: An AC system has many components: compressor, condenser, receiver dryer, evaporator, and hoses. The compressor, the “heart” of the car’s air conditioning system works like a pump taking refrigerant, (R-12 in older cars, R-134a in 1995 and newer cars) and pressurizing it, passing it along to the evaporator. The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working. It is common for the internal parts of the compressor to come apart and disperse metallic debris throughout the system. Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there. For an AC compressor to work, it needs a clutch, bearing, and an electrical connector. The clutch is driven by a drive/serpentine belt, which engages the compressor when you switch on the AC. The clutch can burn or the bearing can fail. If the bearing or clutch have failed, it is recommended that the compressor be replaced.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Turn 10: How is it different from a heat pump?\n",
            "System Response: How They Work While heat pumps and conventional air conditioners differ, they rely on the same principals to condition inside air temperatures. Both systems utilize a compressor to compress refrigerant contained within the system. Inside the compressor, gas is compressed, causing its temperature to rise significantly. The gas then flows through the condensing coil where it cools to ambient temperature. As the gas enters the evaporator coil—located inside the house—it expands, causing its temperature to rapidly drop and cool the evaporator coil. A fan or blower assembly within the air handler draws air through the cooled evaporator coil to provide conditioned air to the home’s interior. The main difference between the two systems is that a heat pump can reverse the process by switching the function of the evaporator and condenser coils to raise inside temperatures. Choosing the Best Option Choosing between a conventional central ac system and a heat pump depends on several factors with the most notable being your climate. Areas of the country subjected to temperatures 40-degrees and lower for extended periods are not ideal for heat pump installation.\n",

[TURN] Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old.

            "No, I meant for lobular. [CTX] I just had a breast biopsy for cancer. What are the most common types? [TURN] More research is needed. Types Breast cancer can be: Ductal carcinoma: This begins in the milk duct and is the most common type. Lobular carcinoma: This starts in the lobules. Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue, increasing the chance of spreading to other parts of the body. Non-invasive breast cancer is when the cancer is still inside its place of origin and has not broken out. [TURN] Once it breaks out, how likely is it to spread? [TURN] Even though this condition doesn’t spread, it’s important to keep an eye on it. Between 20% to 40% of women with this condition will develop a separate invasive breast cancer -- one that will grow outside its original location -- within the next 15 years. Most of the time, these later cancers begin in the milk ducts, rather than the lobules. How is lobular carcinoma in situ diagnosed? You often won’t have any symptoms with LCIS. [TURN] How deadly is it? [TURN] In 1999, a student opened fire at W. R. Myers, killing one student and seriously wounding another. In 2000, LCI was locked down after two youths were arrested and two firearms were seized. Section::::Campus. [TURN] What? No, I want to know about the deadliness of lobular carcinoma in situ. [TURN] It’s sometimes difficult to separate the two conditions and in this case it will be described as lobular neoplasia. Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about. [TURN] Wow, that's better than I thought.  What are common treatments? [TURN] Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy. [TURN] How does it behave differently from PLCIS? [TURN] Wilson said she has “vigilantly monitored” her health with mammograms and MRIs after knowing she had an “underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ).” When a recent breast biopsy revealed PLCIS (pleomorphic carcinoma in situ), initial tests showed that it was not cancerous. But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection. Last week, Taylor Swift revealed that her mother had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and urged her fans to remind their parents about getting screened. [TURN] What makes lobular cancer distinct? [TURN] Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases. [TURN] For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery? [TURN] Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu. These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents. Overall, the 5-year survival rate of invasive ductal carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003. Section::::Treatment.

[TURN] The breast cancer has been detected in the early stages and can be very effectively treated. Stage 1 can be divided into Stage 1A and Stage 1B. The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller). Similar to stage 0, breast cancer at this stage is very treatable and survivable. When breast cancer is detected early, and is in the localized stage, the 5-year relative survival rate is 100%. \n",

Which means eco-friendly and pet friendly claims abound. Read the ingredients. If the bulk of the product is magnesium or calcium chloride, it is a safer and less corrosive salt than the more common sodium chloride or rock salt. [TURN] No.  Which type of driveway is better for the environment? [TURN] These types of surfaces canalso be better for the environment and do not necessarily cost more or require a lot of maintenance. There are three main types of solution to creating a permeable driveway: Using gravel or a mainly green, vegetated area. Directing water from an impermeable surface to a border rain garden or soakaway. Using permeable block paving, porous asphalt or concrete. The most appropriate construction will depend on factors such as the space available, slopes, the type of soil and whether the existing garden gets waterlogged. You can also combine the methods in a single garden to get an interesting appearance. [TURN] And most low-maintenance? [TURN] Cost Chart: Paver Driveway – #1 – Most Expensive Concrete Driveway – #2Asphalt Driveway – #3Gravel Driveway – #4 – Least Expensive A concrete driveway is the second most expensive driveway when comparing it to the other hard surface driveways. Ongoing Maintenance Chart: Gravel Driveway – #1 – Most Ongoing Maintenance Asphalt Driveway – #2Concrete Driveway – #3Paver Driveway – #4 – Least Ongoing Maintenance A concrete driveway requires the second least amount of ongoing maintenance, compared to the other hard surface driveways. Life Expectancy Of A Concrete Driveway A properly installed concrete driveway with regularly scheduled maintenance can last up to 20 or even 30 years! That variation in age can be determined by the stability of the sub-grade, the quality of the installation, the type and frequency of maintenance, the drainage plan and the climate of the region you’re located in. [TURN] Really? What about asphalt? [TURN] Asphalt Driveways Asphalt is one of the most commonly chosen materials for paving driveways and parking lots. During installation, the area will need to be excavated and graded to be paved and allow the base to settle before applying the hot mix asphalt and compacting it with a heavy duty roller. After it has fully curated is when the driveway would be ready for use. Advantages of Asphalt Driveways Asphalt driveways offer a number of advantages including: Longevity – When an asphalt driveway is professionally installed and properly maintained it can last for up to 30 years before needing to be replaced. \n",

Other than its destructive potential, pica can be extremely hazardous to your cat's health if non-food items are consumed. Ingested fabric, string, or other materials can lodge in your cat's stomach or intestine. The blockage prevents the passage of food and may cut off the blood supply to these organs. Both are life-threatening conditions. Cat's that chew on power cords may be electrocuted. Additionally, many common houseplants are toxic to cats; chewing or eating these plants can cause a wide range of symptoms from drooling to death.

[TURN] Commercially available almond milk is often enriched with vitamins A and D, as well as calcium, to make it seem more like regular milk. (Almonds provide some calcium, but not as much as cow’s milk.) Almond milk is low in calories compared to other milk substitutes and contains some heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol. Hemp milk, made by pulverizing the seeds, blending them with water and straining out the solid residue, provides both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in a healthy three-to-one ratio.

Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute.

It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job.

[TURN] Hemp milk Hemp milk, or hemp seed milk, is a plant milk made from hemp seeds that are soaked and ground in water. The result resembles milk in color, texture, and flavor. Hemp is conducive to being organically grown and labeled. Plain hemp milk may be additionally sweetened or flavored. Section::::Production. Production of hemp milk requires hemp seeds, water, and a blender. Many recipes call for ground vanilla or vanilla extract to add flavor, and a type of sweetener. Once all the ingredients are blended together, some people pour the hemp milk through a cheesecloth and strainer to get a smoother and more refined milky texture, but this process is optional. Section::::Use in coffee. Compared to soy milk, in coffee culture, hemp milk is said to produce better latte art and to have a texture more like cow's milk. Section::::Nutrition. In a serving, hemp milk provides 46 calories from 3 g of carbohydrates, 3 g of fat and 2 g of protein. Hemp milk contains no micronutrients in significant amounts. \n",

[TURN] Hot Rod News Comparing Vintage and Modern Funny Cars Written by Brandan Gillogly on February 13, 2016Elana Scherr - writer; Wes Allison - photographer;View All 78 Photos The first Funny Cars showed up in the mid 1960s, how have they changed in the last half century? Race cars develop in fits and spurts. Only rarely can an innovation be traced back to one specific person, although often it’s whoever first won with a new idea that gets credit for it. The modern Funny Car, that nitro-burning, carbon fiber shell set a-trembling over a front engine tube chassis has its roots in the A/FX classes running in 1964 and 1965. Jack Chrisman’s nitro-burning Comet in 1964 showed the crowd-pleasing abilities of a Top Fuel dragster in a dealer showroom suit. The name is rumored to have come from the altered wheelbase bodies that followed in 1965. They looked “funny.” The first flip-top car bodies over dragster chassis showed up in 1966, and that seems to be where the NHRA is marking its 50th anniversary date for the birth of the Funny Car. \n",

All rights reserved. The heart of the Tesla Roadster is its 3-phase, 4-pole electric induction motor, which weighs just 70 pounds. Tesla's claims and independent testing show that the Roadster can reach 60 mph in about four seconds and its speed will top out somewhere around 130 mph. But the Roadster's performance isn't just about speed and acceleration. The unique properties of an electric motor give it a huge advantage over a combustion engine in terms of torque, force that tends to rotate or turn things, and power band, the range of operating speeds under which the engine operates efficiently. The Roadster can generate large amounts of torque even at very low RPM, and the motor can always turn out major horsepower. It can reach over 13,000 RPM, something very few large combustion engines can do.” \n",

[TURN] No, I meant the funny car.  But, that’s interesting. I heard it has a ludicrous mode. How does its quickness compare to the Venom? [TURN] “Over fifty years ago the American-built P51 Mustang fighter aircraft was flown into history powered by a British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. Today the Hennessey Venom GT promises to set a new standard of power to weight ratio in the rarified air of today’s supercar market.”With such a light-weight body and astronomical horsepower, the Hennessey Venom GT can sprint from 0 – 60 in just 2.2 seconds with a top speed of 262 mph on a six-speed manual transmission. Compared to the Bugatti Veyron, which has an acceleration speed from 0 – 60 mph in 2.6 seconds with a top speed of 253 mph, the Hennessey Venom GT may be the “Veyron-killer”. To stop this venomous beast, Brembo brakes with 6-piston calipers are added in front and 4-piston calipers in the rear to give enough clamping power on the massive 15-inch carbon ceramic rotors. Hennessey plans on building 10 units of the Venom GT yearly. Four Hennessey Venom GT’s have already been sold at about $600,000 each in this year. [TURN] It sounds like the Tesla is very competitive.  What makes its engine unique compared with gas ones? [TURN] \"Tesla Roadster Motor and Other Features Prev NEXTThe Roadster motor. Image © 2006 Tesla Motors, Inc. All rights reserved. The Roadster has just three gears. Image © 2006 Tesla Motors, Inc. All rights reserved. The Roaster cockpit. Image © 2006 Tesla Motors, Inc. All rights reserved. The heart of the Tesla Roadster is its 3-phase, 4-pole electric induction motor, which weighs just 70 pounds. Tesla's claims and independent testing show that the Roadster can reach 60 mph in about four seconds and its speed will top out somewhere around 130 mph. But the Roadster's performance isn't just about speed and acceleration. The unique properties of an electric motor give it a huge advantage over a combustion engine in terms of torque, force that tends to rotate or turn things, and power band, the range of operating speeds under which the engine operates efficiently. The Roadster can generate large amounts of torque even at very low RPM, and the motor can always turn out major horsepower. It can reach over 13,000 RPM, something very few large combustion engines can do.” [TURN] I heard they’ve been working on something even faster. [TURN] The Roadster with Maximum Plaid Mode — a nod to a line from the Mel Brooks movie, Spaceballs — cuts that to 1.9 seconds and secures the crown. It will hit 100 in 4.2 seconds and top out “above 250 mph,” according to Musk. For gearheads, he noted the three-motor Roadster will turn out an unprecedented 7,376 pound-feet of torque, more than a diesel 18-wheeler, and 10 times what even some of the world’s most powerful gas sports cars can manage. Meanwhile, the Roadster will have a range of 620 miles of highway driving, Musk added, noting, “You’ll be able to travel from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back without charging.”The Tesla Roadster will hit 100 miles per hour in 4.2 seconds and top out \"\"above 250 mph,\"\" according to CEO Elon Musk. Tesla Good news in a bad week The timing of the two announcements couldn’t come at a better time for Tesla, the company being socked with a series of setbacks in recent weeks. \n",

[TURN] Over the years, the popularity of steroids has varied, but in 2001, it was found that about 2% of high school students used steroids in the past year. History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids.

Weightlifting. Any Winter Olympic sport that involved Russians who competed at the 2014 Sochi Games. Just pick one. If you believe the International Olympic Committee, they doped like there would be no doping tomorrow. And then there are sports (games? pastimes?) that would seem immune to doping because why bother? At the top of that list is bridge, which last we checked is a card game played while seated. But you would be wrong thinking that because the world’s top-ranked bridge player just got himself suspended for doping. As announced Thursday by the World Bridge Federation, Geir Helgemo was suspended for one year after he tested positive for synthetic testosterone and Clomiphene, a fertility drug that accelerates testosterone production in men, after September’s World Bridge Series in Orlando. The WBF said Helgemo — a Norwegian-born player who now competes for Monaco — admitted to doping and accepted his suspension, which ends Nov. \n",

The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you “turn off” the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene. As Dr. Charis Himeda of the University of Massachusetts Medical School told me in a conversation, this technique is a “non-cutting version of CRISPR” that involves the dCas9 protein rather than the Cas9 protein. \n",

Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. [TURN] What are they worried about? [TURN] With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a “gene drive” that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes’ descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors. [TURN] No, I meant in humans. [TURN] That could be for the better, but quite possibly for the worse, since the interrelated genetic functions developed over the long history of evolution remain unknown, despite the advances Baltimore notes. While the ethical and regulatory focus of concern has been on “designer babies” or threats to the human germline, the high risk of unintended consequences also applies to editing the genes of other life forms, from mice and mosquitos to microbes. Some of the top scientists, ethicists and legal experts in the field examine these issues in The WorldPost this week. “Recent leaps in the biosciences, combined with big data analysis, have led us to the cusp of a revolution in medicine,” writes Craig Venter, who led the team that first mapped the human genome and remains on the frontier of new breakthroughs. “Not only have we learned to read and write the genetic code; now we can put it in digital form and translate it back into synthesized life. [TURN] It sounds like it could be used in many places. What other types of organisms has it been tried on? [TURN] Applications as a Genome-editing and Genome Targeting Tool Following its initial demonstration in 2012 (9), the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been widely adopted. This has already been successfully used to target important genes in many cell lines and organisms, including human (34), bacteria (41), zebrafish (32), C. elegans (42), plants (34), Xenopus tropicalis (43), yeast (44), Drosophila (45), monkeys (46), rabbits (47), pigs (42), rats (48) and mice (49). Several groups have now taken advantage of this method to introduce single point mutations (deletions or insertions) in a particular target gene, via a single g RNA (14, 21, 29). Using a pair of g RNA-directed Cas9 nucleases instead, it is also possible to induce large deletions or genomic rearrangements, such as inversions or translocations (50). [TURN] I’ve heard a lot about RNA recently. Can it be used to edit that too? [TURN] Currently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible. CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences. Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA. The represents a promising technology that if successful would reduce the burden of irreversible off-target mutations. [TURN] What’s the difference between the types you mentioned? [TURN] What Is CRISPR? And How Can It Be Used to Turn Genes ‘Off’? June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system. [TURN] That’s too basic, I’d like a more scientific explanation. [TURN] The promise of new CRISPR gene-editing technology has always been that it might lead to a cure for specific genetic diseases. Recently published findings from a team of researchers at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester, Mass., suggest that a modified form of this CRISPR gene-editing technology may eventually result in a cure for facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a form of the disease that leads to progressive muscular degeneration in the face, shoulder blades and upper arms. The new CRISPR technique works by silencing the gene (DUX4) thought to be responsible for the genetic disease. Once you “turn off” the gene, it can no longer encode for the toxic proteins that lead to the deterioration of human skeletal muscle. Unlike other CRISPR techniques that focus on editing a troublesome gene, this modified approach focuses on repressing the gene. As Dr. Charis Himeda of the University of Massachusetts Medical School told me in a conversation, this technique is a “non-cutting version of CRISPR” that involves the dCas9 protein rather than the Cas9 protein. [TURN] The developments sound exciting. What are the commercial issues using it? [TURN] Section::::Applications.:\"In vitro\" genetic depletion. Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant off-target effects as seen with restriction enzymes. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries. Section::::Patents and commercialization. , SAGE Labs (part of Horizon Discovery group) had exclusive rights from one of those companies to produce and sell genetically engineered rats and non-exclusive rights for mouse and rabbit models. , Thermo Fisher Scientific had licensed intellectual property from ToolGen to develop CRISPR reagent kits. , patent rights to CRISPR were contested. Several companies formed to develop related drugs and research tools. As companies ramp up financing, doubts as to whether CRISPR can be quickly monetized were raised. In February 2017 the US Patent Office ruled on a patent interference case brought by University of California with respect to patents issued to the Broad Institute, and found that the Broad patents, with claims covering the application of CRISPR-Cas9 in eukaryotic cells, were distinct from the inventions claimed by University of California. \n",

This is great news if you’re trying to lose weight as it means you may find it easier to cut calories without feeling hungry. In fact, based on these results you could expect to lose up to 2lb a month, simply by eating eggs for breakfast!Eggs are packed with a variety of nutrients including protein, zinc, iron and vitamins A, D, E and B12, but contain just 85 calories each. Old advice to limit eggs to just a few each week has also been abandoned. According to the Food Standards Agency, there’s now no limit to the number of eggs you can eat in a week as part of a healthy balanced diet. [TURN] I’m also a woman over 50. How many do I need to eat to get the recommended amount? [TURN] You’ll get over 3.5 grams of protein from the white of a large egg. Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein. Kinds of Minerals Hard-boiled egg whites contain several minerals, just not in large amounts.

[TURN] “For someone going through these types of situations, the first thing I would ask is about their sleep, nutrition, iron, etc.,” says Kelly Mc Donald, assistant coach at Cal Poly. For competitors asking their bodies to perform at one hundred percent, even a ten percent drop in how one feels is a lot — call it the athlete’s magnification glass to the layman’s perception of tired.

[TURN] Related Articles Fastest Ways to Increase Ferritin How to Raise Hemoglobin Levels Fast How to Raise Your Iron Level Without Supplements Meals for Iron Deficiency Your body requires the mineral iron for a number of crucial functions, including carrying oxygen from your lungs throughout the rest of the body. Ferritin, a protein, serves as a storage form of iron that when low indicates iron deficiency. Your physician interprets your ferritin test results and recommends improving your ferritin levels when tests indicate they are low. With some know-how and dietary changes, you can improve your iron intake so that your ferritin levels increase.1Consume a wide variety of iron-rich foods. Following a restrictive diet that omits many foods increases your risk of having low ferritin. There are two forms of iron – animal foods contain heme iron, while plants contain non-heme iron. Eat plenty of vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains and fortified foods for non-heme iron. You can find heme iron in eggs, meat, fish, poultry and seafood. [TURN] What is the difference between the two types? [TURN] Certain chemicals like polyphenols which are found in tea, coffee, other beverages, and many plants, limit the absorption of non-heme iron. What is the differences between heme iron and nonheme iron?• Heme iron is much more bioavailable than non-heme iron so that heme iron is better absorbed than non heme iron.• Heme iron is found only in animal foods while non-heme iron is found in both animal and plant foods.• Plant foods contain only non-heme iron. Heme irons are absent in the plant foods.• Foods rich in heme-iron can improve the absorption of non-heme iron.• The most abundant dietary iron is non-heme iron. Normally, 60% of non-heme iron is present in animal products. The remaining 40% is heme iron.• Dietary non-heme iron is present as ferric iron (Fe III), and it has to be reduced to ferrous iron (Fe II) in order to be absorbed.• Unlike non-heme iron, heme iron is associated with hemoglobin and myoglobin in the form of ferrous (Fe II) iron.

[TURN] I’m starting to train for a marathon, what should I consider? [TURN] Poor health plagued Rich Roll before he adopted a plant-based diet and began a career as a world-class ultramarathoner in his 40s. And tennis star Venus Williams famously chose a raw vegan regimen five years ago after being diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome, an immune-system disorder that caused her joint pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. Along with these stories comes a common query from incredulous non-vegans: “How do you get enough protein?” “It’s always the first question,” says Torre Washington, a bodybuilder who has been following a vegan diet for 18 years, laughing. “But you really don’t need protein to get shredded and lean. I’m looking for nutrients and focused on variety.” Indeed, vegan athletes including Washington and 10-time Olympic medalist Carl Lewis — who retired from athletic competition in 1997 and has said that athletes have “the worst diets in the world and compete in spite of it” — tend to agree that athletes should put an emphasis on increased calories when in training, as opposed to more protein. \n",

Now, what about the causes in Asia? [TURN] Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato. People are made up of many different things. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, talents, thoughts, and bodies. A mental illness is not the only thing to know about a person. \n",

For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others. [TURN] Could you expand on some of these methods? [TURN] The unique infrageneric diversity of \"Aloe L.\" (\"Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae\") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent. Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative. \"Cannabis sativa\" (intsango). The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam. In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension. \"Carduus tenuiflorus\" (uMhlakavuthwa). The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person. It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself. \"Datura stramonium\" (uQhwangu-qhwangu). Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling. It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision. With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency. [TURN] How effective are these methods and could they be combined with Western medicine? [TURN] African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that \"traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures\". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. [TURN] Okay. Now, what about the causes in Asia? [TURN] Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato. People are made up of many different things. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, talents, thoughts, and bodies. A mental illness is not the only thing to know about a person. [TURN] Is there a relationship between these values and mental illness in the region? [TURN] Some sub-populations of cultures, such as those from India and Pakistan, are reluctant to accept a diagnosis of severe emotional illness or mental retardation because it severely reduces the chances of other members of the family getting married. In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do. \n",

[TURN] The Post painted a heartbreaking picture of the helplessness felt by caregivers of people with mental illness [“Behind the yellow door,” June 29]. In our well-meant efforts to protect people outside the mainstream from abuse, we have lost the ability to provide needed help to those unable to seek it for themselves. Family members must watch a loved one slip deeper into the chaos of a disordered mind, ever fearful that the event that crosses a boundary and requires treatment may also be a tragedy. The National Alliance for Mental Illness provides a free 12-week course for family members. These classes, named Family to Family, are taught by volunteers who have lived through similar frustrations and fears. The course explains the physical nature of mental illness, describes current medications and treatments, and provides practical techniques for effective communication between caregivers and people with mental illness.

[TURN] The unique infrageneric diversity of \"Aloe L.\" (\"Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae\") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent. Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative. \"Cannabis sativa\" (intsango). The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam. In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension. \"Carduus tenuiflorus\" (uMhlakavuthwa). The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person. It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself. \"Datura stramonium\" (uQhwangu-qhwangu). Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling. It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision. With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency. [TURN] How effective are these methods and could they be combined with Western medicine? [TURN] African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Elmasri found that \"traditional healers were the key partner beyond the patients and their families in gaining an understanding of the psychological experience and access to social support structures\". Beliefs are fundamental to behaviour, and therefore a deeper understanding of traditional medicine will help to improve the effectiveness of psychological care. [TURN] Okay. Now, what about the causes in Asia? [TURN] Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato. People are made up of many different things. Everyone has different likes and dislikes, talents, thoughts, and bodies. A mental illness is not the only thing to know about a person. [TURN] Is there a relationship between these values and mental illness in the region? [TURN] Some sub-populations of cultures, such as those from India and Pakistan, are reluctant to accept a diagnosis of severe emotional illness or mental retardation because it severely reduces the chances of other members of the family getting married. In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do. [TURN] Wow. Besides these values, what other factors could cause stigmatization? [TURN] (7) However, the stigmatization of mental illness can be influenced by other factors, such as the perceived cause of the illness. In a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a vignette in which an individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded that the individual’s illness was “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants were asked to rate how they would feel if one of their children dated, married, or reproduced with the subject of the vignette. Genetic attribution of mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce among Chinese Americans, but it increased the same measures among European Americans, supporting previous findings of cultural variations in patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)Many studies have reported other significant differences in attitudes towards mental illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song et al. (2010) conducted an intensive 18-month observation-based ethnographic study of 25 severely mentally ill individuals living in inner city Hartford, Connecticut. [TURN] What about the causes in North America? [TURN] In an interview last year, Resnick said, “you have to remember, people kill for all sorts of reasons. They kill for profit or love or greed.” Mental health advocates say comments such as Trump’s labeling shooters as “mentally ill monsters” can exacerbate false stereotypes about the mentally ill. “When you blame people with mental illness for things like mass shootings, it’s not just untrue,” said Angela Kimball, head of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. “It keeps people from seeking help even when they need it. It spreads unjustified fears about the mentally ill and worsens the stigma around it.\" The 2018 FBI study found that shooters typically experienced several stressors in the year before they attack: financial pressures, fights with classmates or co-workers, and substance abuse. And on average, shooters displayed four to five concerning behaviors that those around them could notice — the most frequent being behavior related to mental health, interpersonal conflicts or some sign of violent intent. Researchers point out that other countries have similar rates of mental illness but a small fraction of America’s gun deaths. [TURN] Hmm. What has the Alliance done to help? [TURN] The Post painted a heartbreaking picture of the helplessness felt by caregivers of people with mental illness [“Behind the yellow door,” June 29]. In our well-meant efforts to protect people outside the mainstream from abuse, we have lost the ability to provide needed help to those unable to seek it for themselves. Family members must watch a loved one slip deeper into the chaos of a disordered mind, ever fearful that the event that crosses a boundary and requires treatment may also be a tragedy. The National Alliance for Mental Illness provides a free 12-week course for family members. These classes, named Family to Family, are taught by volunteers who have lived through similar frustrations and fears. The course explains the physical nature of mental illness, describes current medications and treatments, and provides practical techniques for effective communication between caregivers and people with mental illness. Bob Wirtz, Baltimore [TURN] I found the Indian student's approach to treating depression interesting. Have their approaches been tried elsewhere? [TURN] And, as in America, the rate of suicides, particularly among men, has been rising. So, how to get help to all the people who needed it when there were few financial, technical or material resources? And how to convince people to reach out when their culture made them reluctant to admit their emotional pain for fear of seeming weak or even possessed? To address both, Chibanda stripped mental health care down to basic human connection. He removed the medical and technical elements that made seeking treatment intimidating, and developed a simple solution to enlist the help of lay health workers who could take on matriarchal roles. He first called the meeting spots “mental health benches,” but that was too stigmatizing, so he gave them a more inviting name: “Friendship Benches.” The grandmothers are trained in what is essentially the Western model of cognitive behavioral therapy, but they use indigenous terms that their “patients” can more easily relate to. There’s not even a word for depression in Zimbabwe, that’s too clinical. \n",

[TURN] Why didn't it use rhymes as much? [TURN] Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages. Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line. The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was \"parallelism\", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. \n",

            "Did Biblical poetry have a similar impact? [CTX] How are literary devices used in Biblical poetry? [TURN] A fuller appreciation of the formal literary virtues of Biblical poetry remained unavailable for European Christians until 1754, when Robert Lowth (later made a bishop in the Church of England), kinder to the Hebrew language than his own, published \"Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum\", which identified parallelism as the chief rhetorical device within Hebrew poetry. In many European vernacular literatures, Christian poetry appears among the earliest monuments of those literatures, and Biblical paraphrases in verse often precede Bible translations. In Old English poetry, the \"Dream of the Rood\", a meditation on Christ's crucifixion which adapts Germanic heroic imagery and applies it to Jesus, is one of the earliest extant monuments of Old English literature. Dante Alighieri's \"The Divine Comedy\" represents one of the earliest monuments of Italian vernacular literature. Much Old Irish poetry was the work of Irish monks and is on religious themes. This story is repeated in most European languages. Modern Christian poetry especially suffers from a difficulty of definition. The writings of a Christian poet are not necessarily classified as Christian poetry. [TURN] That's interesting. How is it defined? [TURN] Christian poetry Christian poetry is any poetry that contains Christian teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide allegory. Section::::Overview of Christian poetry. Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins. The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament. Canticles such as the \"Magnificat\" and \"Nunc Dimittis\", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models. Many Biblical scholars also believe that St Paul of Tarsus quotes bits of early Christian hymns in his epistles. Passages such as Philippians 2:5-11 (following) are thought by many Biblical scholars to represent early Christian hymns that were being quoted by the Apostle: Within the world of classical antiquity, Christian poets often struggled with their relationship to the existing traditions of Greek and Latin poetry, which were of course heavily influenced by paganism. [TURN] How did those traditions affect them? [TURN] Paul quotes the pagan poets Aratus and Epimenides in Acts 17:28: \"For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as certain also of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'\" Some early Christian poets such as Ausonius continued to include allusions to pagan deities and standard classical figures and allusions continued to appear in his verse. Other Christian poems of the late Roman Empire, such as the \"Psychomachia\" of Prudentius, cut back on allusions to Greek mythology, but continue the use of inherited classical forms. Other early Christian poets were more innovative. The hymnodist Venantius Fortunatus wrote a number of important poems that are still used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, such as the \"Vexilla Regis\" (\"The Royal Standard\") and \"Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis\" (\"Sing, O my tongue, of the glorious struggle\"). From a literary and linguistic viewpoint, these hymns represent important innovations; they turn away from Greek prosody and instead seem to have been based on the rhythmic marching songs of Roman armies. [TURN] That's interesting about Christianity. How are devices used in Islamic ones? [TURN] Islamic poetry Islamic poetry is poetry written by Muslims. Islamic poetry has been written in many languages. Section::::History and origins. Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers to Mecca (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the quasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran. Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the “Age of Ignorance”. This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran. Islamic poetry is very important and it is a heritage passed from generation to generation. These poems and features examine Muslim faith and Islamic culture and address important events, holidays, and occasions such as Ramadan. These poets explore a range of spiritual, literary, and political concerns from the 6th century to the present day. Also, Islamic poetry was found centuries ago. [TURN] Okay. How does the use of rhyme in Biblical poetry compare? [TURN] The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar), which ensured a rhythm. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call- and-response performance. [TURN] Why didn't it use rhymes as much? [TURN] Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages. Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line. The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was \"parallelism\", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. [TURN] Ahh, it seems like rhyming and parallelism share similar functions. How did both types of poetry influence other kinds of poetry? [TURN] Rhymed prose Rhymed prose is a literary form and literary genre, written in unmetrical rhymes. This form has been known in many different cultures. In some cases the rhymed prose is a distinctive, well-defined style of writing. In modern literary traditions the boundaries of poetry are very broad (free verse, prose poetry, etc.), and some works may be described both as prose and poetry. Section::::Arabic culture and influences. In classic Arabic literature the rhymed prose is called \"saj'\". An elaborate Arabic kind of rhymed prose is \"maqama\". It influenced other cultures of the Muslim world, such as Persian (as exemplified by Saadi's \"Gulestan\") and Turkish (). \"Maqama\" also influenced the medieval Hebrew literature, a significant amount of which was produced by Jews of the Muslim world. It influenced the style of Yehuda Alharizi, Ibn Zabara, Ibn Hasdai (Abraham ben Samuel ha-Levi ibn Hasdai), Ibn Sahula, Jacob ben Eleazer. The corresponding works were called \"maqamat\" or \"mahbarot\" (\"mahberot\", e.g., \"Mahbarot Emmanuel\", by Immanuel the Roman). \n",

Attention to the movement skyrocketed after Tuesday night, when protesters and human rights groups say Nigerian soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Lagos, a metropolis of approximately 20 million. “There was no warning,” one protester told The Washington Post, like others speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. [TURN] Did that help? [TURN] As Human Rights Watch’s Sarah Margon notes, any action to assist the Nigerian army is fraught with moral hazard; this is an army that is responsible for almost as many abuses against civilians in northeastern Nigeria as Boko Haram itself. There are few alternatives to doing so, however. The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves. \n",

[TURN] People in the world’s largest Black nation have taken to the streets to demand one thing of their police: Stop killing us. Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man.

Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States. At their core, the protests carry the same message: A country that allows state security agents to kill and abuse people with impunity is not a mature democracy. And, as in the United States, this is not the first time Nigerians have risen up against police brutality.

The Nigerian Police Force said it has fired at least two officers since the demonstrations began and has said it would probe past atrocities with the help of civil society leaders. Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of the squad’s abuses in the past three years, including beating, hanging, mock execution, sexual assault and waterboarding. In Lagos, chaos escalated on Tuesday following news reports that officers had killed two people. A crowd torched a police station, and protesters blocked roads. Police deployed anti-riot officers to “protect the lives and property of all Nigerians and secure critical national infrastructure across the country,” the department said in a statement. The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people. [TURN] How did the international community respond? [TURN] One month after the kidnapping of more than 300 students in Chibok, Nigeria, international teams from the U.S., U.K., China, France  and Israel have arrived in Nigeria to assist local authorities in the hunt for the 276 girls who are still missing. International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts.

[TURN] There was mention of the protection of Black lives earlier. How is it related to this movement? [TURN] A central question is: Can #BlackLivesMatter protests effect meaningful change in government? My book, “Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State,” examined an earlier movement focused on the protection of black lives. I studied archival materials of the battle by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923. My research showed how the NAACP raised public awareness, met with American presidents, secured the support of Members of Congress, and won a consequential criminal justice victory in the Supreme Court. Drawing from the book’s findings, we can identify three key things to know about ongoing #BlackLivesMatter protests: 1. The fight to protect black lives from unjust state violence has deep historical roots Some people, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, have expressed confusion as to why protesters believe recent police misconduct is emblematic of a system of racial injustice and not just a few bad apples. For many blacks, what is happening right now is not new; it is grounded in a documented history of state violence against black citizens. \n",

[TURN] How Much Does a Fashion Designer Make Monthly? by Chris Newton; Updated September 26, 2017 Fashion design is an exciting career for creative people and people who have a passion for fashion, clothing and accessories. Monthly salaries for fashion designers vary widely, based on employer, experience, location and talent. Fashion designers search for inspiration to sketch, cut and sew fabrics into the next big trend in clothing. Designers might work for a clothing company or design firm, or might work independently and start their own company. According to the Fashion Designer Salary Data website, the average salary range for most fashion designers is between $50,000 and $80,000 a year, which equates to $4,167 and $6,667 a month. Most fashion designers earn about $65,000 annually, or $5,417 per month.

Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills. Talent portfolios can also include video. Animators typically use demo reels, also known as \"demo tapes\", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers. Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works. [TURN] What are the common entry requirements for the degree? [TURN] Education &amp; Training Required Fashion designers typically need an associate or a bachelor's degree in fashion design. Some fashion designers also combine a fashion design degree with a business, marketing, or fashion merchandising degree, especially those who want to run their own business or retail store. Basic coursework includes color, textiles, sewing and tailoring, pattern making, fashion history, computer-aided design (CAD), and design of different types of clothing such as menswear or footwear. Coursework in human anatomy, mathematics, and psychology also is useful.

Many schools do not allow formal entry into a program until a student has successfully completed basic art and design courses.

An artist's portfolio consists of artwork that the artist can take to job interviews, conferences, galleries, and other networking opportunities to showcase his or her work, and give others an idea of what type of genre the artist works in. Art Portfolios, sometimes called \"artfolios\", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs.

Following graduation, some individuals choose to participate in a 1-year internship to fine-tune their veterinary skills and possibly secure more rapid advancement in the field. Licensure Requirements With the occasional exception of employment by federal or state governments, all states and the District of Columbia require newly graduated veterinarians to pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination, in order to practice. D. V. M. candidates must pass an examination on state laws and regulations governing the field of veterinary medicine. Most states require veterinarians to participate in continuing education dealing with newly discovered diseases and newly developed treatments in order to renew a vet's license on a regular basis. Because there is little reciprocity between states, as a general rule, veterinarians who move to a new state must pass that state's licensure examinations. \n",

Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem. \n",

There’s no evidence that domestic pets play “a significant role in spreading the virus,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can pet your dog, walk your dog and play with your dog without worry of contracting the virus from the animal. “If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets,” the CDC recommends. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is spread primarily when infected people cough and sneeze submicroscopic droplets onto smooth surfaces or onto other people. No special precautions need to be taken with the dog; just practice normal hygiene. Check with your veterinarian for more information.

Providing proper nutrition, exercise, and a low-stress environment is the best way to keep your pet healthy. Keeping cats overcrowded may increase stress, lower immunity, and may spread viruses easily, so it is best not to allow this to happen. Comments \n",

[TURN] How so? [TURN] According to the book, initially published last year in Britain, the singer was in such pain that he took Percocet, Darvocet and, during his subsequent scalp treatments, large amounts of Demerol, all of which kick-started decades of dependence on narcotics. That dependence, coupled with financial difficulties that would compel him to agree to a demanding string of performances in London in 2009, set the table for Jackson to become more reliant on Murray, a doctor facing his own money troubles. “Dr. Conrad Murray was not, nor ever would have been, suited to be the caretaker of a complicated patient like Michael Jackson,” the authors state. “And from the moment they met, their fate was sealed.” “83 Minutes” returns often to this idea that Jackson’s demise was inevitable, not only because of Murray’s negligence, but also because of previous doctors who accommodated Jackson’s desire for propofol and other drugs, and Jackson himself, who apparently considered himself immune to the risks. Even though followers of the Murray case and fans of Jackson may be aware of many of the details outlined in “83 Minutes,” revisiting all the pieces of the puzzle in a single volume has a powerful narrative effect. \n",

[TURN] Hemileia vastatrix Hemileia vastatrix is a fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease that is devastating to susceptible coffee plantations. Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (\"Coffea sp.\") in order to survive. There is no cure at the moment, although farms have managed to reduce their impact by replanting infected farms with hybrids that have a strong genetic resistance to rust. Section::::Appearance. The mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter. Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter. Hyphae are club-shaped with tips bearing numerous pedicels on which clusters of urediniospores are produced. Telia are pale yellowish, teliospores often produced in uredinia; teliospores more or less spherical to limoniform, 26–40 × 20–30 µm in diameter, wall hyaline to yellowish, smooth, 1 µm thick, thicker at the apex, pedicel hyaline. \n",

[TURN] What caused the drought? [TURN] Deforestation causing São Paulo drought Written by Chris Fitch Published in Cities Deforestation near São Paulo, Brazil AFNR05 Feb 2015Brazil possesses 12 per cent of the world’s freshwater, and yet São Paulo – the biggest and richest city in South America – is suffering from severe drought with deforestation getting the blame Water rationing. Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry. The proposed reasons for the drought are plentiful. [TURN] I also heard that other Latin American countries had coffee production issues. Was the disruption widespread? [TURN] The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to help Central American farmers fight a devastating coffee disease — and hold down the price of your morning cup. At issue is a fungus called coffee rust that has caused more than $1 billion in damage across the Latin American region. The fungus is especially deadly to Arabica coffee, the bean that makes up most high-end coffees. It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. But the government is not doing this just to protect $4-a-cup specialty coffees, much as Americans love them. The chief concern is about the economic security of small farms abroad. If farmers lose their jobs, it increases hunger and poverty in the region and contributes to violence and drug trafficking. [TURN] It sounds like they are not related. What are its origins? And how did it spread? [TURN] Hemileia vastatrix Hemileia vastatrix is a fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease that is devastating to susceptible coffee plantations. Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (\"Coffea sp.\") in order to survive. There is no cure at the moment, although farms have managed to reduce their impact by replanting infected farms with hybrids that have a strong genetic resistance to rust. Section::::Appearance. The mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter. Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter.

An estimated54 percent of American adults drink coffee every day, and tea won't suffice. Coffee is an exotic plant that can only be grown in very specific ecosystems thousands of miles away, but we've come to see it as a daily staple, and many Americans who depend on drinking it will do so regardless of price increases. There are also longer-term problems that might cause coffee prices to continue rising in the coming years. One is that substantial solutions to the problems of drought and coffee rust take time. Unlike say, corn, planting more coffee during the next growing season won't mean more beans are available at the next harvest — it takes several years for a coffee plant to reach maturity. \n",

The senator has made an “uneventful recovery” from his heart attack, LeWinter said, adding that Sanders has been taking several medications routinely prescribed after heart attacks. “While he did suffer modest heart muscle damage, he has been doing very well since,” LeWinter wrote. LeWinter’s letter was one of three provided by the Sanders campaign, which had said it would release the candidate’s health records by the end of the year. [TURN] What did the doctors do? [TURN] Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders underwent a heart procedure after experiencing chest pains at an event, his campaign said Wednesday. Sanders felt “chest discomfort” Tuesday night at a campaign event, campaign aides said in a statement. Doctors evaluated him, found a blockage in one artery and inserted two stents. The medical problem Sanders experienced — though it can be serious if untreated — is a common affliction in men his age. And the procedure he underwent is one of the most routine performed by cardiologists. “This is a common procedure. It’s very safe. People recover quickly,” said Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve treated businessmen who go back to work the next day. I’ve had patients in the U.S. Senate who have gotten right back to work. Although, if Bernie were my patient, I might tell him not to work 16 hours a day for a little while, just to make sure recovery goes well.” Coronary arteries — arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle — can become blocked over time with the buildup of fatty deposits or plaque. \n",

Did they release theirs? [TURN] The Democratic presidential candidates have been sparring over whether Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been adequately forthcoming about his medical records. At a debate in Las Vegas this month, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg said Sanders needs to disclose “full medical records, do a physical, and release the readout.” The Sanders campaign says demanding greater detail on Sanders’s health resembles “the kind of smear” that demands for Barack Obama’s birth certificate represented. It’s easy to understand why Sanders is not eager to release more of his health history. He’s a 78-year-old who weighs 179 pounds and recently had a heart attack. And he’s not the only one. Of the major Democratic candidates, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have released comprehensive medical reports. Of course, President Trump as a candidate famously released — in lieu of his physical — a letter from a doctor declaring that “if elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” — a letter it later emerged that Trump had dictated himself. \n",

I worry that my daughter will someday wish I’d work the burger line at the team picnic rather than make her cringe by joining in the game. This anxiety isn’t just mine.

[TURN] Intermittent fasting allows the body to use fat as it’s primary source of energy instead of sugar. Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4.

            "Okay. I would eventually like to spend time with my baby while working out too. Do you have any ideas for that? [CTX] I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard. How do I get started? [TURN] Watching a video of my daughter, I catch myself in the background and think, Ugh, you’re moving like him already? I worry that my daughter will someday wish I’d work the burger line at the team picnic rather than make her cringe by joining in the game. This anxiety isn’t just mine. In the time I’ve been alive, the average age for becoming a father in America has climbed 3 1 / 2 years, to 30.9, and higher for the college-educated. But that doesn’t mean we’re older versions of our dads. Just as the boomers who came after my dad discovered jogging and yoga and aerobics, my generation of parents has found its own approach to fitness. We’re the ones who entered adulthood — and who now approach middle age — not just clinging to shreds of our athletic identity but fully expecting that our best physical years are still ahead of us. It’s us driving the growth of high-intensity exercise chains like CrossFit and Orangetheory. [TURN] Okay. Should I try CrossFit? [TURN] It seems as though nearly everyone who has heard of CrossFit has an opinion about it — even people who have never tried it. Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it’s a fast track to injury. CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc. Rather than training people to become very good at a few exercises, CrossFit prompts them to do things that people do in real life, such as getting up and raising things off the ground, Berger says. [TURN] That sounds very intense but useful for me. How does it compare with just weightlifting? [TURN] The paper states that CrossFit participants “are more likely to be injured and to seek medical treatment compared with participants in traditional weightlifting”, a finding that CrossFit, Inc. claimed to be based on scientific errors and material from retracted or mis-represented studies. Section::::Criticism.:Exertional rhabdomyolysis. The relationship between CrossFit and exertional rhabdomyolysis has been a subject of controversy for the company. Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision. CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis. The company states that exertional rhabdomyolysis can be found in a wide variety of sports and training populations and argues that its critics have conflated CrossFit's high awareness of rhabdomyolysis with high risk. [TURN] I would rather be safe. Do the positives outweigh the negatives? [TURN] There’s a kind of dedication, a gleam in the eye that many don’t find in a weekly Zumba class. Many CrossFitters have embraced the criticism. A CrossFit box in Connecticut calls itself “CrossFit Religion” with the motto “In WOD we Trust,” referring to the Workout of the Day that is the foundation of the practice of CrossFit. But J.C. Herz, author of “Learning to Breathe Fire: The Rise of CrossFit and the Primal Future of Fitness,” says that she would class CrossFit as “spiritual but not religious,” similar to yoga. But while many yoga instructors tend to focus more on calming the mind and body, Herz says that CrossFit is spiritual in that every workout asks you to dig deeply. In an age where many are opting out of organized religion, CrossFit provides a rare place of community and holistic transformation. It may not be religious institutionally, but CrossFit does a better job than many religious communities in transforming people’s lives. It may seem strange for what is essentially a fitness program, but CrossFit involves an identity shift that carries over into life well beyond the gym. [TURN] I’ve got four weeks. What about cardio? [TURN] Conclusion Any exercise is bad for you if you overdo it. You can beat yourself into the ground with weight training just as well as with cardio. To borrow a famous phrase, you could do chronic Crossfit just as easily as chronic cardio – and it would be just as dangerous. But it’s time to separate cardio from the “more is better” philosophy. More is not better, but there’s a way to enjoy cardiovascular exercise without compromising your recovery or health!Again, this doesn’t mean that cardio is healthy for everyone, or that it’s required for physical fitness. Every person has a different body type, and different body types are naturally better suited to different exercises. Some people do not do well with cardio, and that’s perfectly fine: just don’t do it. The point of this article isn’t to push cardio on people whose bodies don’t respond to it; it’s to point out that some of us are built more for distance work, and that’s OK, too. [TURN] Okay. What role will diet play? [TURN] Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder. Make sure to eat something that is easily digested and nutritious about half an hour before you exercise. [TURN] What other meal frequencies can I try? [TURN] Intermittent fasting allows the body to use fat as it’s primary source of energy instead of sugar. Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4. Fasting Promotes Longevity Believe it or not, the less you eat the longer you will live. Studies have shown how the lifespan of people in certain cultures increased due to their diets. [TURN] Which one’s better? [TURN] It’s one less decision you have to make every day. It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average. It requires less time (and potentially less money). Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals. Instead of stopping what you’re doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice. Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two. It promotes stronger insulin sensitivity and increased growth hormone secretion, two keys for weight loss and muscle gain. Intermittent fasting helps you create a double whammy for weight loss and building a solid physique. It can level up your brain, including positively counteracting conditions like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia. As explained here in this TEDx talk by Mark Mattson, Professor at Johns Hopkins University and Chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging fasting is grounded in serious research and more studies are coming out showing the benefits: Why fasting bolsters brain power: Mark Mattson at TEDx Johns Hopkins University Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. \n",

Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago.

At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the \"\"K-T boundary\"\", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the \"\"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction\"\". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called \"\"theories\"\", however in this case \"\"hypotheses\"\" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as \"\"hypothesis\"\" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence). \n",

The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. [TURN] Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? [TURN] This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. [TURN] What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? [TURN] Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. [TURN] That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? [TURN] The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. [TURN] Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? [TURN] It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (\"\"ruling reptiles\"\"), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. [TURN] What about the second? [TURN] The Jurassic Period – 199 to 145.5 million years ago Enter the middle period of the Mesozoic Era. In this period, land was breaking up into separate continents. There were new kinds of forests and all the plants that exist today. Species of dinosaurs had become extinct and new species had appeared. Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found. It has been described as having been as tall as 52 feet and as eating herbs, leaves and fruits from the tops of trees. It is described as having existed as long ago as 156 million years and becoming extinct by 145 million years ago. There was also a pigeon-size dinosaur, Epidexipteryx hui, whose remains were discovered in the hills of Inner Mongolia in late 2007. [TURN] And the last? [TURN] \"\"The Cretaceous Period – 145.5 to 65.5 million years ago The Cretaceous Period is the last of the three periods of the Mezoaic Era and is described as the last period with non-flying dinosaurs, a period ending 65.5 million years ago. During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago. It was a villain in the science fiction movie Jurassic Park (although it was not of the Jurassic Period.) T-Rex was an aggressive flesh eater. [TURN] What happened to dinosaurs after then? [TURN] Most dinosaur species lived and died out during this period, but at the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago), all remaining types of dinosaurs (with the exception of birds which had already evolved, and are widely believed to be descended from dinosaurs) died out. At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the \"\"K-T boundary\"\", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the \"\"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction\"\". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called \"\"theories\"\", however in this case \"\"hypotheses\"\" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as \"\"hypothesis\"\" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence). [TURN] How do the evolution of dinosaurs across the three periods compare? [TURN] But the fact is that dinosaur diversity reached its peak in the ensuing Cretaceous period. Geography and Climate During the Jurrasic Period The Jurassic period witnessed the breakup of the Pangaean supercontinent into two big pieces, Gondwana in the south (corresponding to modern-day Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica) and Laurasia in the north (Eurasia and North America). At about the same time, intra-continental lakes and rivers formed that opened new evolutionary niches for aquatic and terrestrial life. The climate was hot and humid, with steady rainfall, ideal conditions for the explosive spread of lush, green plants. Terrestrial Life During the Jurassic Period Dinosaurs: During the Jurassic period, relatives of the small, quadrupedal, plant-eating prosauropods of the Triassic period gradually evolved into multi-ton sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. This period also saw the concurrent rise of medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Megalosaurus. This helps explain the evolution of the earliest, armor-bearing ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. Mammals: The mouse-sized early mammals of the Jurassic period, only recently evolved from their Triassic ancestors, kept a low profile, scurrying around at night or nesting high up in trees so as not to get squashed under the feet of bigger dinosaurs. \n",

The weather, food and amenities were all perfect. The only problem is that a lot of people had the same idea. August being the height of the high season, we predictably had to battle our way through hordes of fellow tourists. Yet not even overcrowding (or the political chaos in Rome) can spoil Bella Italia. You can easily get punch-drunk on its splendors, from Bernini’s sublime statues to the Amalfi Coast’s majestic cliffs.

What’s that? [TURN] A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located. All cathedrals, including the Duomo Cathedral of Florence, are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. The long arms running from west to east are called the nave, and the shorter ones from north to south are the transept. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing. Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other. Sometimes this meant war, but usually the competitions were simply designed to embarrass the other or prove that one city was the richest and most powerful in the area. One popular way to do this was by constructing massive buildings that required lots of money, manpower, and technological innovation. \n",

The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof). \n",

The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime.

[TURN] This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior.

[TURN] By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult).

Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime.

K. and France, that once gave less stringent advice–pregnant women should not exceed 1-2 drinks per week– now state no amount of drinking is safe, and that women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should abstain entirely. At the heart of this debate is the research itself. So, what do we actually know about light drinking during pregnancy? Let’s start with alcohol and the risk of miscarriage. Light drinking, the equivalent of 1-2 drinks per week, during the first trimester, boosts the odds of a first trimester miscarriage by about 30%, and the odds of a early second trimester miscarriage (between 13-16 weeks) by about 70%, according to a large study of over 90,000 pregnancies in Denmark. The risk rose with greater intakes. Drinking 4 or more drinks per week during the first trimester more than doubled the odds of a miscarriage. [TURN] Tell me about the findings from the Lancet study you mentioned. What advice did it give for safety? [TURN] To minimize health risks, the optimal amount of alcohol someone should consume is none. That’s the simple, surprising conclusion of a massive study, co-written by 512 researchers from 243 institutions, published Thursday in the prestigious journal the Lancet. The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you.

            "No, I meant drinking alcohol. What are some rehab treatment options to consider? [CTX] What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? [TURN] By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult). The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. [TURN] What are the causes of it? [TURN] This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. [TURN] Who is at high risk? [TURN] Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction. These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. [TURN] What is a safe amount to drink daily? [TURN] A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. [TURN] What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why? [TURN] S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General first advised women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy in 1981, and issued a new advisory in 2005. The advisory states in part, “Based on the current, best science available we now know the following: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy;Alcohol can damage the embryo or fetus at any stage of pregnancy;Damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows she is pregnant;The cognitive effects and behavioral problems resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are lifelong.”“For these reasons: A pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy;A pregnant woman who has already consumed alcohol during pregnancy should stop in order to minimize further risk;A woman who is considering becoming pregnant should abstain from alcohol.”About half of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a result, many women consume alcohol without knowing that they are pregnant. The Surgeon General’s advisory also suggests that women of childbearing age should consult their physician about how best to reduce the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. [TURN] But I’ve heard that pregnant women in France drink wine with dinner. Is that true? [TURN] \"Why Can't A Pregnant Woman Have A Drink? Margaret Hartmann8/24/10 11:15am 683Many medical experts say it's OK for pregnant woman to have one or two glasses of wine a week, and drinking while pregnant is common in Europe. So why is moderate drinking during pregnancy still taboo in America? While the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still says that \"\"no amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy,\"\" the New York Post reports that a 2009 study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children whose mothers had one or two drinks per week while pregnant did not have an increased risk of cognitive defects compared to those who had no alcohol. One mom tells the Post that her doctor actually told her to \"\"go home and drink a glass of wine,\"\" after having an amniocentesis test because it would help calm painful uterine contractions after the procedure. This would surprise many American moms, but not Europeans; 2008 study published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research said more than 50 percent of French women drank at least once during their pregnancy, compared to only 12 percent of American women. [TURN] So you mean that the US suggestion may be too strict? What is the French government's attitude? [TURN] “You should not drink if you are pregnant, are considering getting pregnant or even if you could possibly get pregnant.”Other countries, like the U.

[TURN] Page contents Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)Varenicline (Champix)Bupropion (Zyban)E-cigarettes If you want to stop smoking, several different treatments are available from shops, pharmacies and on prescription to help you beat your addiction and reduce withdrawal symptoms. The best treatment for you will depend on your personal preference, your age, whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding and any medical conditions you have. Speak to your GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser for advice. Research has shown that all these methods can be effective. Importantly, evidence shows that they are most effective if used alongside support from an NHS stop smoking service. The treatments available are outlined below. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine. NRT is a medication that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke. It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking. \n",

            "No, I meant mania and depression. [CTX] What are the mechanisms of depression? [TURN] The major neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. Many experts believe that an imbalance among the different neurotransmitters is the cause of depression. Although the exact mechanism of action of trazodone is unknown, it probably improves symptoms of depression by inhibiting the uptake of serotonin by nerves in the brain. This results in more serotonin to stimulate other nerves. Trazodone also may increase directly the action of serotonin. [TURN] What is the role of serotonin? [TURN] Techniques For Anxiety The Role of Serotonin When it comes to biological factors for depression, it is commonly accepted that serotonin plays a crucial role. In the brain, this neurotransmitter acts as a relay, transporting messages from one area to another. Given this critical task, an imbalance in serotonin levels may influence our emotions. Since depression is often characterized by negative emotions, the link between this mood disorder and serotonin is obvious. Happiness Hormones Other chemicals that play a crucial role in mood disorders are dopamine and endorphins. [TURN] How can I balance it? [TURN] But you can create your own dopamine rewards by setting a goal, then take small steps toward it every day. This can be starting a new exercise program, learning French, or challenging yourself to drive home from work a different way every day, preferably without the use of your GPS. According to Dr. Graziano Breuning, working on a goal without fail for 45 days will train your brain to stimulate dopamine production in a new way. Dopamine and Mental Conditions Dopamine plays such an important role in how we live our lives, it’s no surprise that when the dopamine system is out of balance it can contribute to many mental conditions. ( 35)Here are three of the most common conditions that have a dopamine connection. [TURN] What foods boost it? [TURN] So the way to increase central nervous system neurotransmitter levels is to provide proper amounts of the amino acid precursor. Bananas, especially ripe bananas, are an exceptional food for regulating dopamine because they have a high concentration of tyrosine. Other foods that increase dopamine through the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine include almonds, apples, watermelons, cherries, yogurt, beans, eggs and meats. It is important to note that dopamine foods alone generally do not have the therapeutic amino acid levels necessary to boost dopamine levels for someone experiencing major depressive disorder. To boost your levels of dopamine, dopamine rich foods may not be adequate. [TURN] How does the phenylalanine convert to tyrosine? [TURN] Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein. Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine. Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues. Section::::Structure. Catecholamines have the distinct structure of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups, an intermediate ethyl chain, and a terminal amine group. Phenylethanolamines such as norepinephrine have a hydroxyl group on the ethyl chain. [TURN] Can these drugs alleviate depression? [TURN] Predictions from the Catecholamine Theory of Mood The catecholamine theory makes the following predictions: Drugs wich destroy CAs should produce depression Drugs which increase CAs should alleviate depression Drugs used to test the Catecholamine Theory of Mood You now have a body of knowledge that can be used to test the catecholamine theory of mood. Drug Effect on the catecholamines DA and NA Predicted effect on depression Reserpine depletes CAs produce depression Tetrabenazine (TBZ) depletes CAs for a shorter length of time than reserpine produce depression Alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT)inhibits the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase - stops CA synthesis produce depression FLA-63 inhibits the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase - stops conversion of DA into NA. Theory does not make clear prediction Disulphiram inhibits the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase - stops conversion of DA into NA.

[TURN] Does this theory explain the cause of depression? [TURN] The British wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill , suffered from what he called \"\"Black Dog\"\", Churchill's name for depression The recent Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, may have experienced periods of depression.

Points to ponder Is this a correlational or a causal theory? [TURN] Can a person have both at the same time? [TURN] Two of the most common mental health disorders among people in the United States are depression and anxiety. Nearly 8 percent of people over 12 suffer from depression, according to the Centers for Disease Control, while the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) states that anxiety disorders affect more than 18 percent of adults. While these two types of disorders are very different on the surface, there are a number of similarities between them that can make it difficult to distinguish between the two without a deeper knowledge of how each disorder manifests. At the same time, many people will experience both disorders at the same time. The following comparison helps to illuminate the similarities and differences between depression and anxiety.

The diagnosis of either will then fall into a category and a subcategory. What follows is a list of Common Mood Disorders: Depressive Disorders Major depressive disorders are on our list of mood disorders and are subcategorized into a single episode or recurrent episodes, in which two or more depressive episodes occur. The core symptoms of depression include: Sadness, apathy, unhappiness, apathy, anxiety. Pessimism, guilt, negative thinking, low motivation, poor concentration, suicidal thoughts. Lack of interest in personal appearance and hygiene, agitation, sluggish movements. Changes in appetite, constipation, loss of sex drive, sleep disturbances, menstrual cycle disruption. Manic Disorders The core symptoms of mania include: Elation, grandiosity, irritability. Pressure of thoughts, easily distractible with flighty ideas and poor judgement. Overactive speech. High levels of arousal and decreased need for sleep. \n",

Athletically speaking, that is. “Bobby is just a fine young man,” Johnny said recently. “I couldn’t be prouder of him.” Bobby, who is 6-foot-7 and weighs 225 pounds, played some baseball when younger. Bobby said he got some of his height from his mother, Laura, who is tall at 6-foot. (Johnny is 6-1). Bobby mostly played first base in baseball. He was a decent athlete but, as a baseball player, was no Johnny Bench. Who could be? When Bobby was cut from St. Xavier baseball tryouts as both a freshman and a sophomore, he realized how impossible it could be to be who he was. \n",

The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces. \n",

[TURN] Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs.

As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice. \n",

[TURN] That’s great. What makes it so efficient? [TURN] It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium. \n",

[TURN] Cool science. But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones. [TURN] If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. \n",

            "How is it different from a heat pump? [CTX] I saw an online ad for a house with descriptions saying it has a heat pump. What is that? [TURN] \"The Heat Pump The heat pump is merely an air conditioner with a reversing valve, check valves, and a defrost mechanism. The outdoor compressor runs in the summer to cool and in the winter to heat. The Short Story Let me contrast a heat pump with a regular AC using electric strip heat. A heat pump will save you 50% in the heating mode, but it will lose 10% when cooling. For the Brazos Valley, what you lose in the summer will not be recovered in the winter. Numerous AC researchers and managers of utilities—with the exception of one man—have agreed in their conversations with me: A heat pump, in our community, is not cost effective. There is no utility savings, and it can be very expensive to repair. The Entire Story The utility companies push heat pumps because they want to balance the load on their generators, but there is absolutely no other justification for a heat pump in our community. The homeowner has nothing to gain and everything to lose. [TURN] What are some other choices to heat my home? [TURN] If your home is currently heated by an inefficient heat source, for example oil, you’ll see much lower heating costs with a heat pump. The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces. [TURN] What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? [TURN] Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3. The sources used by heat pumps are limited, and are somewhat eco-friendly. [TURN] A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? [TURN] Installing a heat pump can make a huge difference in your electricity bill by decreasing the cost of heating and cooling your home. A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. The average cost to install a heat pump ranges from $3,997 and $6,879 depending on the size of your home and type of heat pump. Since a geothermal heat pump requires underground installation, its installation costs will be more expensive than the costs for the air-source type. Though the cost of the heat pump and labor fees may be a significant investment, it can drastically reduce your energy consumption. Consider the following factors before installing a heat pump: On This Page: Heat Pump Installation Cost Considerations Heat Pump Prices Types of Heat Pumps How Does a Heat Pump Work? Benefits of a Heat Pump Heat Pump Tax Credits &amp; Rebates Installation Cost Considerations The difficulty associated with the excavation of the ground will affect the installation costs. Make sure to consult a few installation professionals and get a number of bids, as this installation can vary significantly in price. [TURN] Which type is better in terms of efficiency? [TURN] Geothermal vs. Air-Source Heat Pumps – Weighing the Pros and Cons Nov 8, 2013 | Blog The geothermal heat pump is quickly gaining popularity for efficient, eco-friendly heating. In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice. [TURN] How many years will it take to recoup the investment? [TURN] Even with this significant front-end investment, geothermal systems are so energy-stingy that the payback period is remarkably brief. A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. \"\"It's a win-win arrangement,\"\" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities. [TURN] That’s great. What makes it so efficient? [TURN] It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium. [TURN] Cool science. But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones.

[TURN] Tell me about AC systems. [TURN] An AC system has many components: compressor, condenser, receiver dryer, evaporator, and hoses. The compressor, the “heart” of the car’s air conditioning system works like a pump taking refrigerant, (R-12 in older cars, R-134a in 1995 and newer cars) and pressurizing it, passing it along to the evaporator. The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working. It is common for the internal parts of the compressor to come apart and disperse metallic debris throughout the system. Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there. For an AC compressor to work, it needs a clutch, bearing, and an electrical connector. The clutch is driven by a drive/serpentine belt, which engages the compressor when you switch on the AC. The clutch can burn or the bearing can fail. If the bearing or clutch have failed, it is recommended that the compressor be replaced. \n",

[TURN] Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old.

[TURN] For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery? [TURN] Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu. These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents. Overall, the 5-year survival rate of invasive ductal carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003. Section::::Treatment.

If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy. [TURN] How does it behave differently from PLCIS? [TURN] Wilson said she has “vigilantly monitored” her health with mammograms and MRIs after knowing she had an “underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ).” When a recent breast biopsy revealed PLCIS (pleomorphic carcinoma in situ), initial tests showed that it was not cancerous. But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection. Last week, Taylor Swift revealed that her mother had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and urged her fans to remind their parents about getting screened. [TURN] What makes lobular cancer distinct? [TURN] Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases. [TURN] For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery? [TURN] Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu. These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents. Overall, the 5-year survival rate of invasive ductal carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003. Section::::Treatment. Treatment of invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) depends on the size of the mass (size of the [TURN] No, I meant for lobular. [TURN] The breast cancer has been detected in the early stages and can be very effectively treated. Stage 1 can be divided into Stage 1A and Stage 1B. The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller). Similar to stage 0, breast cancer at this stage is very treatable and survivable. When breast cancer is detected early, and is in the localized stage, the 5-year relative survival rate is 100%. \n",

If you think a second pet will help alleviate loneliness, boredom or behavior problems with your resident pet, think again. If you don't have time to spend with one cat, you surely will not have time to spend with two. Many cat owners end up with two bored and misbehaving pets instead of one.

            "What does the slow blink mean? [CTX] Why do cats eat plastic? [TURN] \"The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult.\" Cats also display pica behavior in their natural environments and there is evidence to support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica. Cats have been observed to start by chewing and sucking on non-nutritive substances like wool, cotton, rubber, plastic and even cardboard and then progress into ingestion of these substances. This type of behavior occurs through the first four years of a cat's life but it is primarily observed during the first two months of life when cats are introduced into new homes is most common. Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early weaning and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame. [TURN] Will it kill him? [TURN] This stress can be passed on to puppies and kittens affecting their disposition, personality and behavior. Premature weaning stresses the developing immune system. Moreover, the time they spend away from their mother while in the puppy mill, subjected to the same stressful living conditions, is highly stressful. But that’s not the end of their stress. Shipping to pet stores puts them through a great deal of stress. [TURN] What?  No.  Will eating plastic kill my cat? [TURN] Any object may be a potential target, however. Why is Pica Dangerous? Other than its destructive potential, pica can be extremely hazardous to your cat's health if non-food items are consumed. Ingested fabric, string, or other materials can lodge in your cat's stomach or intestine. The blockage prevents the passage of food and may cut off the blood supply to these organs. Both are life-threatening conditions. Cat's that chew on power cords may be electrocuted. Additionally, many common houseplants are toxic to cats; chewing or eating these plants can cause a wide range of symptoms from drooling to death. If your cat has a history of ingesting non-food items and becomes lethargic, vomits, or displays other concerning behavior, take them to your veterinarian immediately. Why Does My Cat Eat/Chew on Non-food Items? No one knows exactly why some cats exhibit pica behavior. Because pica has been associated with a variety of diseases including feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus, a veterinarian should examine any cat with pica. [TURN] How do I get him to stop? [TURN] If there has been a change in your life recently — moving to a different house, a new schedule, new roommate, outdoor construction — your cat might be acting out because of anxiety. Begin by addressing the cause of the stress (do a web search for \"\"stressed cat\"\" and you’ll find lots of advice on how to do that) and spending time with your cat to help her adapt. Ease the Boredom Feline pica is also pretty common in bored or lonely cats. You can ease a cat’s boredom by providing environmental enrichment. Give him puzzle toys including things such as rolling treat balls to keep him busy while you’re away at work. [TURN] Should I get a second one? [TURN] \"Introducing a Second Cat or Pet Before bringing a new pet into your heart and home, ask yourself, \"\"Why do I want another pet?\"\" Two pets are not necessarily just as easy or just as much work as one. Another pet will require time, energy, expense and patience. Many people who do not have enough time for one pet think that two will be better because they will keep each other company. If you think a second pet will help alleviate loneliness, boredom or behavior problems with your resident pet, think again. If you don't have time to spend with one cat, you surely will not have time to spend with two. Many cat owners end up with two bored and misbehaving pets instead of one. Furthermore, a second pet will not necessarily provide your cat with the companionship you have in mind. If you are willing to put in the time, patience and expense of a second pet, then take a look at your cat's desires. [TURN] What are his desires? [TURN] It helps your cat feel secure in their environment and around people as they are left alone often during the day. Hiding - Little Mo loves to play hiding games with her self where I think she is imaging that she is hiding from prey or another cat and loves to pounce out of the box at the most unexpected moment. Provide old cardboard boxes around the house with a few toys inside for added fun. Catnip - Many cats love catnip, it relaxes them and they seem to really go crazy for it. Toys can be bought with catnip inside or you could even provide your indoor cat with their own little tray of fresh growing catnip for them to chew on. Cat videos - Many cats like the sound of human voices being around during the day, it may help them to feel secure. You could leave a radio on for them, or for a bit more variety of sounds and visual stimulus, you could buy them specially designedcat videos to leave on during the day. \n",

[TURN] Oat seems popular now.  Why? [TURN] Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (\"Avena spp.\") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

Sure, full-fat dairy products taste better than the skim/fat-free versions, but I don’t eat them for the taste. I eat full-fat dairy because it’s better for my health and my weight. Yep, you heard me right: I eat dairy products with all the fat god gave ‘em, and I do it because it’s good for me. Here’s why:1. Our bodies cannot digest the protein or absorb the calcium from milk without the fat. Love This? Never Miss Another Story.2. Vitamins A and D are also fat-soluble. So you can’t absorb them from milk when all the fat has been skimmed off. (This makes fortified skim milk the biggest sham of all — you can pump fat-free milk full of a year’s supply of vitamins A and D, but the body can’t access them).3. [TURN] No, the vegan ones. Which of those alternatives is healthiest? [TURN] There are a ton of nondairy milks to choose from, but which one is the healthiest?»RELATED: Milk in the fridge? Someone may owe you money To find out, researchers from Mc Gill University recently conducted an experiment, published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology, to determine the nutritional value of plant-based milk beverages. To do so, they compared the health benefits of the four most popular alternative milks, including soy, almond, coconut and rice. They examined the number of calories and amount of protein, fat and carbohydrates found in each. They also looked into the vitamins and minerals the substitutes contained. While they said cow’s milk still has the most nutritional value, with 8 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat and 11.5 grams of carbs, soy is the most comparable for overall balance. It’s “a clear winner,” they wrote in a statement. It has more protein than all the other milk options analyzed, with 7 to 12 grams and 95 calories a glass. [TURN] Can I make it at home? [TURN] Soy milk maker A soy milk maker is a small kitchen appliance which automatically cooks soy milk, a non-dairy beverage made from soy beans. Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker. Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages. Homemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value. Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products. Ordinary methods for making soy milk at home are often very labor-intensive (requiring beans to be soaked, ground in a blender, strained, and then cooked). Soy milk machines perform many of these steps automatically, greatly simplifying home-based soy milk production. Section::::Standard operation. Before use, dried beans are rinsed with water to remove particulate debris, soaked for 6–10 hours to moisten and soften the dried beans, and then rinsed again before use. [TURN] Oat seems popular now.  Why? [TURN] Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (\"Avena spp.\") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA). Section::::History. Section::::History.:Creation. Soy milk predates all other alternative milks, including oat milk, both as a cultural and commercial product. [TURN] I’m going to bake some cookies. Which one would be the best to use? [TURN] One cup of soy milk provides 4 grams of unsaturated fat, 1 gram of fiber, and 7 grams of protein. Soymilk has 75% more antioxidants than cow’s milk. It is hearty, rich and creamy. Soy milk is good for drinking straight from the glass, poured over cereal or in coffee. The taste is nutty and slightly sweet. When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow’s milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job. That means that soy milk is also the best choice when making vegan buttermilk for Vegan Buttermilk Biscuits or for dredging to make breaded dishes like “Chicken-Fried” Tofu Steaks. \n",

            "What is the best in my morning latte? [CTX] What are the benefits of cow milk? [TURN] Cow milk seems to be everywhere and is often taken for granted, but it has many important health benefits, including its ability to aid in weight loss, build strong bones and teeth, boost the immune system, reduce fat, protect the heart, prevent diabetes, eliminate inflammation, and help stimulate growth. Cow Milk No matter where you are on the planet, you’ve almost certainly come across cow milk. In most parts of the world, it is the primary [ 1] animal milk consumed by humans, although goat, sheep, and even camel milk are popular based on the availability of animals. Cow milk (derived from bovines) is intended for sucking by young cows, just as human infants are often nursed with human breast milk. However, the nutritional value and availability of cow’s milk have made it one of the most in-demand liquids on the planet. More than 6 billion people on the planet drink milk on a semi-regular basis, which means that these animals are an incredibly important part of our global nutritional needs. [TURN] What about an alternative. I’ve heard it's also made from almonds? [TURN] Commercially available almond milk is often enriched with vitamins A and D, as well as calcium, to make it seem more like regular milk. (Almonds provide some calcium, but not as much as cow’s milk.) Almond milk is low in calories compared to other milk substitutes and contains some heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol. Hemp milk, made by pulverizing the seeds, blending them with water and straining out the solid residue, provides both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in a healthy three-to-one ratio.

I'm aware that over use of soy in food products may be a health concern to many readers as of this writing due to some health studies that have been published. In vegan baking we're using so little of it that if you're concerned about it you really shouldn't be eating baked items in the first place because the sugar and glycemic index issues are a much more serious health issue. Remember that most things in moderation are ok. If you're still concerned or allergic to soy then it's great that we now have hemp milk as a soy-free alternative. Its wonderful to finally be in an age where we have so many alternatives to dairy milk to choose from. \n",

[TURN] Hemp milk Hemp milk, or hemp seed milk, is a plant milk made from hemp seeds that are soaked and ground in water. The result resembles milk in color, texture, and flavor. Hemp is conducive to being organically grown and labeled. Plain hemp milk may be additionally sweetened or flavored. Section::::Production. Production of hemp milk requires hemp seeds, water, and a blender. Many recipes call for ground vanilla or vanilla extract to add flavor, and a type of sweetener. Once all the ingredients are blended together, some people pour the hemp milk through a cheesecloth and strainer to get a smoother and more refined milky texture, but this process is optional. Section::::Use in coffee. Compared to soy milk, in coffee culture, hemp milk is said to produce better latte art and to have a texture more like cow's milk. Section::::Nutrition. In a serving, hemp milk provides 46 calories from 3 g of carbohydrates, 3 g of fat and 2 g of protein. Hemp milk contains no micronutrients in significant amounts. \n",

In an e-mail sent to the Denver Post, Welker seemingly takes aim at the league’s drug-testing policy. The league is only saying that Welker tested positive for amphetamine. A source told the Denver Post’s Mike Klis that the amphetamine in question was adderall, not MDMA (aka Molly) as was speculated by some on Tuesday. As Deadspin points out, MDMA is indeed an amphetamine, but it falls under the league’s recreational-drug policy, not its performance-enhancing drug policy, so it’s seemingly not the drug in question here. Last September, the Denver Post wrote about how the NFL deals with adderall, a commonly prescribed drug that treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but one that also causes feelings of exhilaration, increased energy and mental alertness when used in a non-prescribed manner. It is classified as a performance-enhancing drug and a drug of abuse by the NFL. \n",

[TURN] Over the years, the popularity of steroids has varied, but in 2001, it was found that about 2% of high school students used steroids in the past year. History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. [TURN] What were Ziegler’s improvements? [TURN] John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (\"ca.\" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying \"It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?\". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983. Section::::Biography. Section::::Biography.:Early life. Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. [TURN] Why are they banned? [TURN] The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory.

There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. [TURN] What other diseases are caused by a single change? [TURN] The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. [TURN] What are the other types of diseases? [TURN] 3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope. Down Syndrome is the most well known disease caused by chromosomal abnormalities. In this disorder there is a third copy of chromosome 21 (there are two copies of each chromosome in the cells of healthy humans). Chromosomal diseases can be also caused by segments and joins of parts of chromosomes. [TURN] You missed the second type of disease.  What was that? [TURN] A large genetic mistake typically occurs in the woman's egg, which may partially explain why older women are more likely to have babies with Down syndrome . Many chromosome errors cause the fetus to be aborted before birth, but some syndromes can be born and survive, though all typically suffer severe mental and physical defects. Down syndrome is the most common and well-known chromosome defect, but there are many. Types of chromosome diseases: There are several common types of chromosome errors that cause disease. The effects of errors in the sex chromosomes (X and Y) differ greatly from errors in the autosomes (chromosomes 1..22). [TURN] That’s not what I wanted. How about recent developments in gene therapy to treat those defects? [TURN] This is all happening with ­dizzying speed. CRISPR has spawned two contentious, parallel debates, with Doudna squarely in the middle of both. The first is the ethical issue raised by the mother of the child with Down syndrome: How far should we go in editing the human genome? The new technique potentially enables changes in the human “germline” cells, which could entail changes not only to a single person’s genome but also to that of any of the person’s descendants. Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. [TURN] What are they worried about? [TURN] With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a “gene drive” that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes’ descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors.

June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system. \n",

How many do I need to eat to get the recommended amount? [TURN] You’ll get over 3.5 grams of protein from the white of a large egg. Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein. Kinds of Minerals Hard-boiled egg whites contain several minerals, just not in large amounts. You’ll get some of the bone-building minerals -- calcium, magnesium and phosphorus -- as well as the electrolyte minerals potassium and sodium. Electrolytes conduct electricity for muscle and heart functions. This lean protein source even has a bit of iron, a mineral you need for blood processes, as well as antioxidant minerals zinc and selenium. \n",

[TURN] I heard eating eggs might help. [TURN] Need to Lose Weight? Enter your details to calculate your ideal weight range, and discover how soon you could reach it!Imperial Metric Height ft in Weight st lb Weight Loss Resources says…This study suggests that eating eggs for breakfast makes you feel fuller for longer so that you eat less at your next few meals. This is great news if you’re trying to lose weight as it means you may find it easier to cut calories without feeling hungry. In fact, based on these results you could expect to lose up to 2lb a month, simply by eating eggs for breakfast!Eggs are packed with a variety of nutrients including protein, zinc, iron and vitamins A, D, E and B12, but contain just 85 calories each. Old advice to limit eggs to just a few each week has also been abandoned. According to the Food Standards Agency, there’s now no limit to the number of eggs you can eat in a week as part of a healthy balanced diet. [TURN] I’m also a woman over 50. How many do I need to eat to get the recommended amount? [TURN] You’ll get over 3.5 grams of protein from the white of a large egg. Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein. Kinds of Minerals Hard-boiled egg whites contain several minerals, just not in large amounts. You’ll get some of the bone-building minerals -- calcium, magnesium and phosphorus -- as well as the electrolyte minerals potassium and sodium. Electrolytes conduct electricity for muscle and heart functions. This lean protein source even has a bit of iron, a mineral you need for blood processes, as well as antioxidant minerals zinc and selenium. [TURN] I’m starting to train for a marathon, what should I consider? [TURN] Poor health plagued Rich Roll before he adopted a plant-based diet and began a career as a world-class ultramarathoner in his 40s. And tennis star Venus Williams famously chose a raw vegan regimen five years ago after being diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome, an immune-system disorder that caused her joint pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. Along with these stories comes a common query from incredulous non-vegans: “How do you get enough protein?” “It’s always the first question,” says Torre Washington, a bodybuilder who has been following a vegan diet for 18 years, laughing. “But you really don’t need protein to get shredded and lean. I’m looking for nutrients and focused on variety.” Indeed, vegan athletes including Washington and 10-time Olympic medalist Carl Lewis — who retired from athletic competition in 1997 and has said that athletes have “the worst diets in the world and compete in spite of it” — tend to agree that athletes should put an emphasis on increased calories when in training, as opposed to more protein. \n",

[TURN] Is there a relationship between these values and mental illness in the region? [TURN] Some sub-populations of cultures, such as those from India and Pakistan, are reluctant to accept a diagnosis of severe emotional illness or mental retardation because it severely reduces the chances of other members of the family getting married. In Vietnamese culture, mystical beliefs explain physical and mental illness. Health is viewed as the result of a harmonious balance between the poles of hot and cold that govern bodily functions. Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do. \n",

In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent.

He first called the meeting spots “mental health benches,” but that was too stigmatizing, so he gave them a more inviting name: “Friendship Benches.” The grandmothers are trained in what is essentially the Western model of cognitive behavioral therapy, but they use indigenous terms that their “patients” can more easily relate to.

[TURN] Rhymed prose Rhymed prose is a literary form and literary genre, written in unmetrical rhymes. This form has been known in many different cultures. In some cases the rhymed prose is a distinctive, well-defined style of writing. In modern literary traditions the boundaries of poetry are very broad (free verse, prose poetry, etc.), and some works may be described both as prose and poetry. Section::::Arabic culture and influences. In classic Arabic literature the rhymed prose is called \"saj'\". An elaborate Arabic kind of rhymed prose is \"maqama\". It influenced other cultures of the Muslim world, such as Persian (as exemplified by Saadi's \"Gulestan\") and Turkish (). \"Maqama\" also influenced the medieval Hebrew literature, a significant amount of which was produced by Jews of the Muslim world. It influenced the style of Yehuda Alharizi, Ibn Zabara, Ibn Hasdai (Abraham ben Samuel ha-Levi ibn Hasdai), Ibn Sahula, Jacob ben Eleazer. The corresponding works were called \"maqamat\" or \"mahbarot\" (\"mahberot\", e.g., \"Mahbarot Emmanuel\", by Immanuel the Roman). \n",

[TURN] Did that help? [TURN] As Human Rights Watch’s Sarah Margon notes, any action to assist the Nigerian army is fraught with moral hazard; this is an army that is responsible for almost as many abuses against civilians in northeastern Nigeria as Boko Haram itself. There are few alternatives to doing so, however. The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves. \n",

The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves. [TURN] My friend also mentioned that women were instrumental to the movement. What was their role? [TURN] Nigeria’s #EndSARS movement has spawned over 150 mass protests in cities across the country, with demonstrations intensifying after soldiers reportedly fired live rounds into protesters at the Lekki toll plaza in Lagos on Oct. 20. The movement has also inspired solidarity protests in major cities of the world, including London, New York, Berlin and Washington. Women play a leading role in the ongoing #EndSARS movement against police brutality and government violence in Nigeria, specifically seeking to abolish a federal police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. One nascent women’s group in particular, the Feminist Coalition, has used digital platforms to mobilize funds and design strategies to support protesters across Nigeria. The Feminist Coalition’s work in the #EndSARS movement continues a long history of women leading and supporting political mobilizations across Africa. This engagement, however, has typically been minimized or ignored outright in the retelling of the events. Here’s what you need to know. Who are the Feminist Coalition?

            "There was mention of the protection of Black lives earlier. How is it related to this movement? [CTX] A friend said there were massive protests in Nigeria towards the end of 2020. What happened? [TURN] People in the world’s largest Black nation have taken to the streets to demand one thing of their police: Stop killing us. Over the last 10 days, Nigerians have been protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, a unit of the Nigerian federal police force, after a video emerged of officers allegedly killing a man. Soon the hashtag #EndSars, as the unit is known, began trending internationally. Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military dictator, announced that SARS will be disbanded, but that promise has not been enough to quell the anger. Nigerians continue to protest. Nigeria’s movement comes as protests demanding the protection of Black lives continue in the United States. At their core, the protests carry the same message: A country that allows state security agents to kill and abuse people with impunity is not a mature democracy. And, as in the United States, this is not the first time Nigerians have risen up against police brutality. Amnesty International documented at least 82 cases of torture, extrajudicial killings, extortion and rape by SARS between January 2017 and May 2020. [TURN] Why was the Squad established in the first place? [TURN] Now he doesn’t drive after dark. On that October night last year, he said, the officers drained his bank account. His lawyer called the police station. Nothing happened. “You kind of give up on these things,” Olaitan said. SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter. Temi Afolabi, a lawyer in Lagos, said officers have a reputation for searching phones at random and detaining people for outrageous reasons. [TURN] What's an example of those reasons? [TURN] The officers, who often worked in plain clothes, developed a reputation for stopping young people, accusing them of theft and then stealing their money, activists say. The Nigerian Police Force said it has fired at least two officers since the demonstrations began and has said it would probe past atrocities with the help of civil society leaders. Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of the squad’s abuses in the past three years, including beating, hanging, mock execution, sexual assault and waterboarding. In Lagos, chaos escalated on Tuesday following news reports that officers had killed two people. A crowd torched a police station, and protesters blocked roads. Police deployed anti-riot officers to “protect the lives and property of all Nigerians and secure critical national infrastructure across the country,” the department said in a statement. The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people. [TURN] How did the international community respond? [TURN] One month after the kidnapping of more than 300 students in Chibok, Nigeria, international teams from the U.S., U.K., China, France  and Israel have arrived in Nigeria to assist local authorities in the hunt for the 276 girls who are still missing. International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts. [TURN] Okay, but I meant their response to the EndSars protests. [TURN] What started as a grass-roots movement to end police brutality in Africa’s most populous country has become a global phenomenon embraced by the world’s biggest celebrities: #EndSARS. In the two weeks since Nigerians began flooding the streets to rally against a police unit widely viewed as abusive, overseas megastars such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Cardi B and Drake have thrown their fame behind the cause. Now the protest is dominating social media feeds on practically every continent and, by Wednesday, had made its way into the U.S. presidential race. “The United States must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,” Democratic nominee Joe Biden said in a statement. Attention to the movement skyrocketed after Tuesday night, when protesters and human rights groups say Nigerian soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Lagos, a metropolis of approximately 20 million. “There was no warning,” one protester told The Washington Post, like others speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution.

[TURN] There was mention of the protection of Black lives earlier. How is it related to this movement? [TURN] A central question is: Can #BlackLivesMatter protests effect meaningful change in government? My book, “Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State,” examined an earlier movement focused on the protection of black lives. I studied archival materials of the battle by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923. My research showed how the NAACP raised public awareness, met with American presidents, secured the support of Members of Congress, and won a consequential criminal justice victory in the Supreme Court. Drawing from the book’s findings, we can identify three key things to know about ongoing #BlackLivesMatter protests: 1. The fight to protect black lives from unjust state violence has deep historical roots Some people, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, have expressed confusion as to why protesters believe recent police misconduct is emblematic of a system of racial injustice and not just a few bad apples. For many blacks, what is happening right now is not new; it is grounded in a documented history of state violence against black citizens. \n",

Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works. \n",

Most fashion designers earn about $65,000 annually, or $5,417 per month. Some designers earn considerably more, especially those who own their own successful fashion design company and design clothes for wealthy people and celebrities. They can easily make a few million dollars each year, or hundreds of thousands a month. [TURN] How can I get a degree in it? [TURN] The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that a bachelor's degree related to fashion design is usually needed to gain an entry-level position in the industry ( www.bls.gov ). A common type of degree is the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), which may have a major in fashion or fashion design. You might also get to pursue a specialization, such as knitwear, intimate apparel, visual merchandising, textiles, special occasion wear or children's wear. BFA Program Requirements A BFA program in fashion or fashion design provides you with opportunities to study in-depth topics through electives or core curriculum, and studio courses give you hands-on experience. In addition to studying fashion, you might also take courses in business or merchandising. Although your chosen specialization can affect your program's curriculum requirements, common topics of study include the following:2-D and 3-D fashion design Fashion drawing Sewing techniques Art and fashion history Fashion color Textiles Fashion draping Before you graduate, you will usually create a portfolio and complete an internship. [TURN] Okay. What does the portfolio usually consist of? [TURN] A typical type of a portfolio is one used by artists. An artist's portfolio consists of artwork that the artist can take to job interviews, conferences, galleries, and other networking opportunities to showcase his or her work, and give others an idea of what type of genre the artist works in. Art Portfolios, sometimes called \"artfolios\", can be a variety of sizes, and usually consist of approximately ten to twenty photographs of the artist's best works. Some artists create multiple portfolios to showcase different styles and to apply for different types of jobs. For instance, one portfolio may be mainly for doing technical illustrations and another may be for surreal painting or sculpture. Models and actors often use electronic portfolios to showcase their career with a digital display of their photos, biographies and skills. Talent portfolios can also include video. Animators typically use demo reels, also known as \"demo tapes\", in place of or in addition to portfolios to demonstrate their skills to potential employers. Demo tapes have historically been short VHS tapes, but most are now DVDs. Demo reels are normally less than two minutes in length and showcase some of the animator's best works. [TURN] What are the common entry requirements for the degree? [TURN] Education &amp; Training Required Fashion designers typically need an associate or a bachelor's degree in fashion design. Some fashion designers also combine a fashion design degree with a business, marketing, or fashion merchandising degree, especially those who want to run their own business or retail store. Basic coursework includes color, textiles, sewing and tailoring, pattern making, fashion history, computer-aided design (CAD), and design of different types of clothing such as menswear or footwear. Coursework in human anatomy, mathematics, and psychology also is useful. The National Association of Schools of Art and Design accredits approximately 300 postsecondary institutions with programs in art and design. Most of these schools award degrees in fashion design. Many schools do not allow formal entry into a program until a student has successfully completed basic art and design courses. Applicants usually have to submit sketches and other examples of their artistic ability. Aspiring fashion designers can learn these necessary skills through internships with design or manufacturing firms. Some designers also gain valuable experience working in retail stores, as personal stylists, or as custom tailors. [TURN] I’ll consider those. How about my options for my other interest? [TURN] Teen Vogue indicates that aspiring fashion magazine journalists may want to study English or journalism, while those working with fashion photography may pursue design-related degrees. Fashion merchandising bachelor's degrees are another option for those aspiring to enter all fashion journalism fields. Because the job markets in the fashion and journalism industries can be competitive, you may want to pursue a college internship in your professional area of interest. Some journalism degree programs may offer concentrations in fashion or magazine writing; the latter may be appropriate for those aspiring to work for fashion magazines. If you pursue a degree in general journalism, one or several fashion writing classes are likely available to you. Some schools may also offer special seminars, clubs or other activities for journalism students interested in fashion. Fashion journalism courses or concentrations teach you about relevant general and journalism-specific concepts, such as visual merchandising, textiles, fashion marketing, event reporting, trend analysis and designer collection reviews. You also study basic journalism topics like news reporting, mass media and society magazine writing, opinion commentary, copyediting, promotional writing and media law. [TURN] Not quite.

[TURN] It's during veterinary school that many students decide to concentrate on becoming large animal vets, dealing with farm animals, such as horses and cows, or small animal vets, dealing with domestic pets, such as dogs and cats. Following graduation, some individuals choose to participate in a 1-year internship to fine-tune their veterinary skills and possibly secure more rapid advancement in the field. Licensure Requirements With the occasional exception of employment by federal or state governments, all states and the District of Columbia require newly graduated veterinarians to pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination, in order to practice. D. V. M. candidates must pass an examination on state laws and regulations governing the field of veterinary medicine. Most states require veterinarians to participate in continuing education dealing with newly discovered diseases and newly developed treatments in order to renew a vet's license on a regular basis. Because there is little reciprocity between states, as a general rule, veterinarians who move to a new state must pass that state's licensure examinations. \n",

[TURN] I live in a remote area. How can I treat it at home? [TURN] Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic). \n",

This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully.

[TURN] Home Swollen Ear Ear Care: Swollen Dog Ear Quick Links Overview Problems Infections Scratching Itching Swelling Treatment Reader &amp; Vet Q&amp;ACauses: The most common and famous reason amongst researchers for dog swollen ear is inflammation. Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem. [TURN] How dangerous could these be? [TURN] Each hospital is different though and you should talk with the veterinarians in your area. Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it.

[TURN] I live in a remote area. How can I treat it at home? [TURN] Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic). [TURN] My cat is also having similar symptoms. Would that work for her as well? [TURN] WARNING: Do not use this method if the ears are red and swollen or have any open wounds. Garlic and Olive Oil combined are great for treating ear mites. Crush garlic and soak it overnight in warm olive oil. Throw away the clove and warm up the olive oil. Add 5 drops to each ear for 21 days. This remedy also smothers the ear mites. My favorite is Aloe and Calendula essential oils. They are very soothing to the kitty’s ears and have worked wonders for getting rid of the ear mites. Both oils are available at your local health food store. Add several drops to the kitty’s ears once daily for 21 days. The oils have a healing effect so if your kitty has inflamed or painful ears, this will help. These are the best remedies for cats with ear mites and now you can choose the conventional or the holistic approach. Your cat will feel much better and she will love you for it. \n",

There’s no evidence that domestic pets play “a significant role in spreading the virus,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can pet your dog, walk your dog and play with your dog without worry of contracting the virus from the animal. “If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets,” the CDC recommends. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is spread primarily when infected people cough and sneeze submicroscopic droplets onto smooth surfaces or onto other people.

[TURN] Other risk factors may include: stress sanitation issues crowding in the home parasites Cats can also spread the coronavirus in their feces, nasal secretions, and oral secretions. The feline coronavirus can remain inactive and harmless in the home, but it is very easy to destroy the virus with regular cleaning habits. The feline coronavirus poses no threat to humans. How to Prevent the Feline Coronavirus and FIP While it is impossible to know which cats will develop the FIP condition after being infected with the coronavirus, there are several things pet owners can do to possibly prevent the coronavirus from occurring in the first place. Making sure your cat's healthy and has a strong immune system is important in preventing disease. Providing proper nutrition, exercise, and a low-stress environment is the best way to keep your pet healthy. Keeping cats overcrowded may increase stress, lower immunity, and may spread viruses easily, so it is best not to allow this to happen. Comments \n",

While filming a Pepsi commercial in 1984, Jackson was badly burned during the sixth take of the ad. He had to have skin grafts and balloons implanted in his scalp as part of his recovery. In an attempt to ease his ongoing discomfort, a plastic surgeon tried to eliminate some of Jackson’s scar tissue. “For this procedure, as well as Michael’s continuing struggles with discoid lupus and acne scarring— plus his continuing experiments with his nose, chin, and cheekbones— Klein and Debbie Rowe administered pain medication,” Knopper writes. “They were careful not to give too much, Rowe recalls. \n",

[TURN] How so? [TURN] According to the book, initially published last year in Britain, the singer was in such pain that he took Percocet, Darvocet and, during his subsequent scalp treatments, large amounts of Demerol, all of which kick-started decades of dependence on narcotics. That dependence, coupled with financial difficulties that would compel him to agree to a demanding string of performances in London in 2009, set the table for Jackson to become more reliant on Murray, a doctor facing his own money troubles. “Dr. Conrad Murray was not, nor ever would have been, suited to be the caretaker of a complicated patient like Michael Jackson,” the authors state. “And from the moment they met, their fate was sealed.” “83 Minutes” returns often to this idea that Jackson’s demise was inevitable, not only because of Murray’s negligence, but also because of previous doctors who accommodated Jackson’s desire for propofol and other drugs, and Jackson himself, who apparently considered himself immune to the risks. Even though followers of the Murray case and fans of Jackson may be aware of many of the details outlined in “83 Minutes,” revisiting all the pieces of the puzzle in a single volume has a powerful narrative effect. \n",

[TURN] Okay. The US government tried to help the situation. What did they do to help? [TURN] The Washington region will get some professional counseling in hopes of improving its paltry performance in selling its goods and services abroad. The Global Cities Initiative, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and JPMorgan Chase, will oversee an in-depth study to help the area figure out how to boost exports to offset some of the economic pain caused by the slowdown in federal spending. A coalition of three regional organizations — representing government, businesses and universities — asked for the help by applying to join the initiative. They did so because the Washington area, despite including a major world capital, is near the bottom of the heap when it comes to doing business overseas. Among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Washington ranks 98th in the share of its economic activity fueled by exports, according to Brookings. That contributed to the region’s weak economic growth rate from 2010 to 2014, which ranked 93rd. Greater Washington’s entry in the initiative was perhaps the most significant of a series of recent efforts to foster increased cooperation among the District, Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs in response to the federal spending cuts known as sequestration. \n",

White, fragrant flowers have appeared, followed by cherry-like fruit, each containing two seeds: Arabica coffee beans, the most popular in the world.

[TURN] Deforestation causing São Paulo drought Written by Chris Fitch Published in Cities Deforestation near São Paulo, Brazil AFNR05 Feb 2015Brazil possesses 12 per cent of the world’s freshwater, and yet São Paulo – the biggest and richest city in South America – is suffering from severe drought with deforestation getting the blame Water rationing. Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry. The proposed reasons for the drought are plentiful. [TURN] I also heard that other Latin American countries had coffee production issues. Was the disruption widespread? [TURN] The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to help Central American farmers fight a devastating coffee disease — and hold down the price of your morning cup. At issue is a fungus called coffee rust that has caused more than $1 billion in damage across the Latin American region. The fungus is especially deadly to Arabica coffee, the bean that makes up most high-end coffees. It is affecting the price of some of those coffees in the United States. “We are concerned because we know coffee rust is already causing massive amounts of devastation,” said Raj Shah, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. On Monday, he was expected to announce a $5 million partnership with Texas A&amp;M University’s World Coffee Research center to try to eliminate the fungus. But the government is not doing this just to protect $4-a-cup specialty coffees, much as Americans love them. The chief concern is about the economic security of small farms abroad.

And how did it spread? [TURN] Hemileia vastatrix Hemileia vastatrix is a fungus of the order Pucciniales (previously also known as Uredinales) that causes coffee leaf rust (CLR), a disease that is devastating to susceptible coffee plantations. Coffee serves as the obligate host of coffee rust, that is, the rust must have access to and come into physical contact with coffee (\"Coffea sp.\") in order to survive. There is no cure at the moment, although farms have managed to reduce their impact by replanting infected farms with hybrids that have a strong genetic resistance to rust. Section::::Appearance. The mycelium with uredinia looks yellow-orange and powdery, and appears on the underside of leaves as points ~0.1 mm in diameter. Young lesions appear as chlorotic or pale yellow spots some millimetres in diameter, the older being a few centimetres in diameter. Hyphae are club-shaped with tips bearing numerous pedicels on which clusters of urediniospores are produced. Telia are pale yellowish, teliospores often produced in uredinia; teliospores more or less spherical to limoniform, 26–40 × 20–30 µm in diameter, wall hyaline to yellowish, smooth, 1 µm thick, thicker at the apex, pedicel hyaline. [TURN] Okay. The US government tried to help the situation. What did they do to help? [TURN] The Washington region will get some professional counseling in hopes of improving its paltry performance in selling its goods and services abroad. The Global Cities Initiative, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and JPMorgan Chase, will oversee an in-depth study to help the area figure out how to boost exports to offset some of the economic pain caused by the slowdown in federal spending. A coalition of three regional organizations — representing government, businesses and universities — asked for the help by applying to join the initiative. They did so because the Washington area, despite including a major world capital, is near the bottom of the heap when it comes to doing business overseas. Among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Washington ranks 98th in the share of its economic activity fueled by exports, according to Brookings. That contributed to the region’s weak economic growth rate from 2010 to 2014, which ranked 93rd.

An estimated54 percent of American adults drink coffee every day, and tea won't suffice. Coffee is an exotic plant that can only be grown in very specific ecosystems thousands of miles away, but we've come to see it as a daily staple, and many Americans who depend on drinking it will do so regardless of price increases. There are also longer-term problems that might cause coffee prices to continue rising in the coming years. One is that substantial solutions to the problems of drought and coffee rust take time. Unlike say, corn, planting more coffee during the next growing season won't mean more beans are available at the next harvest — it takes several years for a coffee plant to reach maturity. \n",

[TURN] How did it affect the campaign? [TURN] Sen. Bernie Sanders’s admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate’s age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign. Sanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return “soon” to the campaign trail. “I’m feeling so much better,” Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane. But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president. The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 — each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office. “I think anybody’s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,” said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. \n",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who suffered a heart attack in October and is the oldest major candidate for president in 2020, released information from three of his doctors Monday saying that he sustained “modest heart muscle damage” but is in good health and capable of doing the job. “At this point, I see no reason he cannot continue campaigning without limitation and, should he be elected, I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency,” Martin M. LeWinter, attending cardiologist at the University of Vermont Medical Center, wrote in a letter dated Dec. 30. The senator has made an “uneventful recovery” from his heart attack, LeWinter said, adding that Sanders has been taking several medications routinely prescribed after heart attacks. “While he did suffer modest heart muscle damage, he has been doing very well since,” LeWinter wrote. LeWinter’s letter was one of three provided by the Sanders campaign, which had said it would release the candidate’s health records by the end of the year. [TURN] What did the doctors do? [TURN] Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders underwent a heart procedure after experiencing chest pains at an event, his campaign said Wednesday. Sanders felt “chest discomfort” Tuesday night at a campaign event, campaign aides said in a statement. Doctors evaluated him, found a blockage in one artery and inserted two stents. The medical problem Sanders experienced — though it can be serious if untreated — is a common affliction in men his age. And the procedure he underwent is one of the most routine performed by cardiologists. “This is a common procedure. It’s very safe. People recover quickly,” said Steven Nissen, chair of cardiovascular medicine at Cleveland Clinic. “I’ve treated businessmen who go back to work the next day. I’ve had patients in the U.S. Senate who have gotten right back to work. Although, if Bernie were my patient, I might tell him not to work 16 hours a day for a little while, just to make sure recovery goes well.” Coronary arteries — arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle — can become blocked over time with the buildup of fatty deposits or plaque. [TURN] How did it affect the campaign? [TURN] Sen. Bernie Sanders’s admission late Friday that he had suffered a heart attack three days earlier invited new scrutiny of the presidential candidate’s age, health and ability to keep up with the rigors of a national campaign. Sanders released a video hours after he was discharged from a Las Vegas hospital, thanking well-wishers for their support and promising to return “soon” to the campaign trail. “I’m feeling so much better,” Sanders said, his arm draped around his wife, Jane. But neither Sanders (I-Vt.) nor his campaign offered details about how serious his condition was, leaving open the question of how soon he would reemerge and whether voters would lose confidence in his ability to serve as president. The episode also brought new attention to a Democratic field that is dominated by three septuagenarians: Sanders, 78; former vice president Joe Biden, 76; and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), 70 — each of whom would be the oldest president ever to take office. “I think anybody’s health is of concern when it comes to that high office,” said Jeremy Dumkrieger, chairman of the Woodbury County, Iowa, Democratic Party, who supported Sanders in 2016 but is neutral so far this year. [TURN] How did he attempt to regain the public's confidence? [TURN] Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who suffered a heart attack in October and is the oldest major candidate for president in 2020, released information from three of his doctors Monday saying that he sustained “modest heart muscle damage” but is in good health and capable of doing the job. “At this point, I see no reason he cannot continue campaigning without limitation and, should he be elected, I am confident he has the mental and physical stamina to fully undertake the rigors of the presidency,” Martin M.

Did they release theirs? [TURN] The Democratic presidential candidates have been sparring over whether Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been adequately forthcoming about his medical records. At a debate in Las Vegas this month, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg said Sanders needs to disclose “full medical records, do a physical, and release the readout.” The Sanders campaign says demanding greater detail on Sanders’s health resembles “the kind of smear” that demands for Barack Obama’s birth certificate represented. It’s easy to understand why Sanders is not eager to release more of his health history. He’s a 78-year-old who weighs 179 pounds and recently had a heart attack. And he’s not the only one. Of the major Democratic candidates, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have released comprehensive medical reports. Of course, President Trump as a candidate famously released — in lieu of his physical — a letter from a doctor declaring that “if elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” — a letter it later emerged that Trump had dictated himself. \n",

CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc. Rather than training people to become very good at a few exercises, CrossFit prompts them to do things that people do in real life, such as getting up and raising things off the ground, Berger says. \n",

[TURN] Intermittent fasting allows the body to use fat as it’s primary source of energy instead of sugar. Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4. Fasting Promotes Longevity Believe it or not, the less you eat the longer you will live. Studies have shown how the lifespan of people in certain cultures increased due to their diets. \n",

The point of this article isn’t to push cardio on people whose bodies don’t respond to it; it’s to point out that some of us are built more for distance work, and that’s OK, too. [TURN] Okay. What role will diet play? [TURN] Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder. Make sure to eat something that is easily digested and nutritious about half an hour before you exercise. [TURN] What other meal frequencies can I try? [TURN] Intermittent fasting allows the body to use fat as it’s primary source of energy instead of sugar. Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4. Fasting Promotes Longevity Believe it or not, the less you eat the longer you will live. Studies have shown how the lifespan of people in certain cultures increased due to their diets. [TURN] Which one’s better? [TURN] It’s one less decision you have to make every day. It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average. It requires less time (and potentially less money). Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals. Instead of stopping what you’re doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice. Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two. It promotes stronger insulin sensitivity and increased growth hormone secretion, two keys for weight loss and muscle gain. Intermittent fasting helps you create a double whammy for weight loss and building a solid physique. It can level up your brain, including positively counteracting conditions like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia. As explained here in this TEDx talk by Mark Mattson, Professor at Johns Hopkins University and Chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging fasting is grounded in serious research and more studies are coming out showing the benefits: Why fasting bolsters brain power: Mark Mattson at TEDx Johns Hopkins University Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. \n",

[TURN] Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? [TURN] It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (\"\"ruling reptiles\"\"), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. \n",

PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle.

[TURN] What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? [TURN] Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. [TURN] That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? [TURN] The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. [TURN] Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? [TURN] It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (\"\"ruling reptiles\"\"), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. [TURN] What about the second? [TURN] The Jurassic Period – 199 to 145.5 million years ago Enter the middle period of the Mesozoic Era. In this period, land was breaking up into separate continents. There were new kinds of forests and all the plants that exist today. Species of dinosaurs had become extinct and new species had appeared. Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found. It has been described as having been as tall as 52 feet and as eating herbs, leaves and fruits from the tops of trees. It is described as having existed as long ago as 156 million years and becoming extinct by 145 million years ago.

Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the \"\"K-T boundary\"\", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the \"\"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction\"\". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called \"\"theories\"\", however in this case \"\"hypotheses\"\" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as \"\"hypothesis\"\" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence). \n",

[TURN] \"\"The Cretaceous Period – 145.5 to 65.5 million years ago The Cretaceous Period is the last of the three periods of the Mezoaic Era and is described as the last period with non-flying dinosaurs, a period ending 65.5 million years ago. During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago. It was a villain in the science fiction movie Jurassic Park (although it was not of the Jurassic Period.) T-Rex was an aggressive flesh eater. [TURN] What happened to dinosaurs after then? [TURN] Most dinosaur species lived and died out during this period, but at the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago), all remaining types of dinosaurs (with the exception of birds which had already evolved, and are widely believed to be descended from dinosaurs) died out. At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the \"\"K-T boundary\"\", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the \"\"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction\"\". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called \"\"theories\"\", however in this case \"\"hypotheses\"\" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as \"\"hypothesis\"\" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence). [TURN] How do the evolution of dinosaurs across the three periods compare? [TURN] But the fact is that dinosaur diversity reached its peak in the ensuing Cretaceous period. Geography and Climate During the Jurrasic Period The Jurassic period witnessed the breakup of the Pangaean supercontinent into two big pieces, Gondwana in the south (corresponding to modern-day Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica) and Laurasia in the north (Eurasia and North America). At about the same time, intra-continental lakes and rivers formed that opened new evolutionary niches for aquatic and terrestrial life. The climate was hot and humid, with steady rainfall, ideal conditions for the explosive spread of lush, green plants. Terrestrial Life During the Jurassic Period Dinosaurs: During the Jurassic period, relatives of the small, quadrupedal, plant-eating prosauropods of the Triassic period gradually evolved into multi-ton sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. This period also saw the concurrent rise of medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Megalosaurus. This helps explain the evolution of the earliest, armor-bearing ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. Mammals: The mouse-sized early mammals of the Jurassic period, only recently evolved from their Triassic ancestors, kept a low profile, scurrying around at night or nesting high up in trees so as not to get squashed under the feet of bigger dinosaurs. \n",

At 7mm (0.27 inches) long, Paedophryne amauensis may be the world's smallest vertebrate - the group that includes mammals, fish, birds and amphibians. The researchers also found a slightly larger relative, Paedophryne swiftorum. Presenting the new species in PLo S One journal, they suggest the frogs' tiny scale is linked to their habitat, in leaf litter on the forest floor. What are amphibians? First true amphibians evolved about 250 million years ago Three orders: frogs (inc. toads), salamanders (inc. newts) and the limbless caecilians Adapted to many aquatic and terrestrial habitats Present on every continent except Antarctica Many metamorphose from larvae to adults Amphibians videos, news and facts: BBC Nature Finding the frogs was not an easy assignment. \n",

            "Cool!  What kinds of innovations? [CTX] I want to go on vacation somewhere in Europe with good food. What are some beautiful places? [TURN] Adding a third city is dealer’s choice, but I’d go with Amsterdam, a 3½ -hour journey from Paris via high-speed Thalys train. All of these cities are walkable and offer mass transit, so no stress about driving a rental car in unfamiliar territory. If this is only the first of many future trips to Europe, delving into one country makes sense. Italy would be my choice, as it offers so many different personalities. Rome, Florence and Venice are the top three cities for first-timers. Fly into Venice, take Trenitalia trains to Florence and Rome, then fly home from Rome. From Florence, add a day trip to the Tuscan countryside. From Venice, visit the Dolomites (Italian Alps). If renting a car isn’t an option, ask your concierge to recommend a driver for side trips or book day tours through a company such as City Wonders or Viator. Q: What’s the best way to pay for hotels, meals, transportation, et cetera, during my upcoming trip to Europe? [TURN] Yes, it'll be my first time. Where should I consider? [TURN] RAVELLO, Italy — There are two kinds of people: Those who like active vacations and those who like sedentary vacations. I’m one of the weird hybrids who likes both. That makes me, I suppose, the Jekyll and Hyde of holidayers. Luckily, my partner — who is the boss not only of her two boys but also of me — shares my dual mind-set. Accordingly, my family and I began our recent trip to Italy with an educational visit to Rome and Pompeii and ended with a sybaritic idyll on the Amalfi Coast. The weather, food and amenities were all perfect. The only problem is that a lot of people had the same idea. August being the height of the high season, we predictably had to battle our way through hordes of fellow tourists. Yet not even overcrowding (or the political chaos in Rome) can spoil Bella Italia. You can easily get punch-drunk on its splendors, from Bernini’s sublime statues to the Amalfi Coast’s majestic cliffs. One of the highlights was a few nights on Capri, a small isle in the Tyrrhenian Sea that has hosted pleasure seekers since the days when Emperor Tiberius built villas there. [TURN] What should I not miss on the Coast? [TURN] Details, Amalfi Coast It was late morning by the time my friend Karen and I arrived in Amalfi (via bus, train and boat from Naples), and the central plaza was buzzing.

What’s that? [TURN] A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located. All cathedrals, including the Duomo Cathedral of Florence, are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. The long arms running from west to east are called the nave, and the shorter ones from north to south are the transept. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing. Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other. Sometimes this meant war, but usually the competitions were simply designed to embarrass the other or prove that one city was the richest and most powerful in the area. One popular way to do this was by constructing massive buildings that required lots of money, manpower, and technological innovation. \n",

The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof). \n",

[TURN] What is a safe amount to drink daily? [TURN] A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. \n",

            "But I’ve heard that pregnant women in France drink wine with dinner. Is that true? [CTX] What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? [TURN] By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult). The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. [TURN] What are the causes of it? [TURN] This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. [TURN] Who is at high risk? [TURN] Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction. These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. [TURN] What is a safe amount to drink daily? [TURN] A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. [TURN] What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why? [TURN] S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General first advised women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy in 1981, and issued a new advisory in 2005. The advisory states in part, “Based on the current, best science available we now know the following: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy;Alcohol can damage the embryo or fetus at any stage of pregnancy;Damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows she is pregnant;The cognitive effects and behavioral problems resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are lifelong.”“For these reasons: A pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy;A pregnant woman who has already consumed alcohol during pregnancy should stop in order to minimize further risk;A woman who is considering becoming pregnant should abstain from alcohol.”About half of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a result, many women consume alcohol without knowing that they are pregnant. The Surgeon General’s advisory also suggests that women of childbearing age should consult their physician about how best to reduce the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. \n",

The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you. What’s best for you is to not drink at all,” she said. \n",

The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. [TURN] What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why? [TURN] S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General first advised women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy in 1981, and issued a new advisory in 2005. The advisory states in part, “Based on the current, best science available we now know the following: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy;Alcohol can damage the embryo or fetus at any stage of pregnancy;Damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows she is pregnant;The cognitive effects and behavioral problems resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are lifelong.”“For these reasons: A pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy;A pregnant woman who has already consumed alcohol during pregnancy should stop in order to minimize further risk;A woman who is considering becoming pregnant should abstain from alcohol.”About half of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a result, many women consume alcohol without knowing that they are pregnant. The Surgeon General’s advisory also suggests that women of childbearing age should consult their physician about how best to reduce the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. [TURN] But I’ve heard that pregnant women in France drink wine with dinner. Is that true? [TURN] \"Why Can't A Pregnant Woman Have A Drink? Margaret Hartmann8/24/10 11:15am 683Many medical experts say it's OK for pregnant woman to have one or two glasses of wine a week, and drinking while pregnant is common in Europe. So why is moderate drinking during pregnancy still taboo in America? While the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still says that \"\"no amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy,\"\" the New York Post reports that a 2009 study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children whose mothers had one or two drinks per week while pregnant did not have an increased risk of cognitive defects compared to those who had no alcohol. One mom tells the Post that her doctor actually told her to \"\"go home and drink a glass of wine,\"\" after having an amniocentesis test because it would help calm painful uterine contractions after the procedure. This would surprise many American moms, but not Europeans; 2008 study published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research said more than 50 percent of French women drank at least once during their pregnancy, compared to only 12 percent of American women. [TURN] So you mean that the US suggestion may be too strict? What is the French government's attitude? [TURN] “You should not drink if you are pregnant, are considering getting pregnant or even if you could possibly get pregnant.”Other countries, like the U. K. and France, that once gave less stringent advice–pregnant women should not exceed 1-2 drinks per week– now state no amount of drinking is safe, and that women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should abstain entirely. At the heart of this debate is the research itself. So, what do we actually know about light drinking during pregnancy? Let’s start with alcohol and the risk of miscarriage. Light drinking, the equivalent of 1-2 drinks per week, during the first trimester, boosts the odds of a first trimester miscarriage by about 30%, and the odds of a early second trimester miscarriage (between 13-16 weeks) by about 70%, according to a large study of over 90,000 pregnancies in Denmark. The risk rose with greater intakes. Drinking 4 or more drinks per week during the first trimester more than doubled the odds of a miscarriage. [TURN] Tell me about the findings from the Lancet study you mentioned. What advice did it give for safety? [TURN] To minimize health risks, the optimal amount of alcohol someone should consume is none. That’s the simple, surprising conclusion of a massive study, co-written by 512 researchers from 243 institutions, published Thursday in the prestigious journal the Lancet. The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you. What’s best for you is to not drink at all,” she said. [TURN] I’d like to stop. What are some treatment options? [TURN] Page contents Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)Varenicline (Champix)Bupropion (Zyban)E-cigarettes If you want to stop smoking, several different treatments are available from shops, pharmacies and on prescription to help you beat your addiction and reduce withdrawal symptoms. The best treatment for you will depend on your personal preference, your age, whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding and any medical conditions you have. Speak to your GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser for advice. Research has shown that all these methods can be effective. Importantly, evidence shows that they are most effective if used alongside support from an NHS stop smoking service. The treatments available are outlined below. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine. NRT is a medication that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke. It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking. \n",

[TURN] Two of the most common mental health disorders among people in the United States are depression and anxiety. Nearly 8 percent of people over 12 suffer from depression, according to the Centers for Disease Control, while the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) states that anxiety disorders affect more than 18 percent of adults. While these two types of disorders are very different on the surface, there are a number of similarities between them that can make it difficult to distinguish between the two without a deeper knowledge of how each disorder manifests. At the same time, many people will experience both disorders at the same time. The following comparison helps to illuminate the similarities and differences between depression and anxiety. Are You Self-Medicating A Mood Disorder Disorder We Treat Addiction &amp; Mood Disorders Simultaneously (973) 862-4820Message Us Symptoms Depression The symptoms of depression include more than just persistent sadness or an empty feeling. Depression can manifest in many additional ways, according to NIMH, with the following symptoms, among others: Feelings of anxiety, restlessness, or irritability Hopelessness and loss of motivation Decreased feelings of pleasure Decreased energy Insomnia or other sleep disturbances Inability to focus or concentrate Changes in appetite Aches and pains Digestive problems Many of these symptoms may be surprising, given the typical understanding of depression. \n",

            "What are the types of bipolar? [CTX] What are the mechanisms of depression? [TURN] The major neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. Many experts believe that an imbalance among the different neurotransmitters is the cause of depression. Although the exact mechanism of action of trazodone is unknown, it probably improves symptoms of depression by inhibiting the uptake of serotonin by nerves in the brain. This results in more serotonin to stimulate other nerves. Trazodone also may increase directly the action of serotonin. [TURN] What is the role of serotonin? [TURN] Techniques For Anxiety The Role of Serotonin When it comes to biological factors for depression, it is commonly accepted that serotonin plays a crucial role. In the brain, this neurotransmitter acts as a relay, transporting messages from one area to another. Given this critical task, an imbalance in serotonin levels may influence our emotions. Since depression is often characterized by negative emotions, the link between this mood disorder and serotonin is obvious. Happiness Hormones Other chemicals that play a crucial role in mood disorders are dopamine and endorphins. [TURN] How can I balance it? [TURN] But you can create your own dopamine rewards by setting a goal, then take small steps toward it every day. This can be starting a new exercise program, learning French, or challenging yourself to drive home from work a different way every day, preferably without the use of your GPS. According to Dr. Graziano Breuning, working on a goal without fail for 45 days will train your brain to stimulate dopamine production in a new way. Dopamine and Mental Conditions Dopamine plays such an important role in how we live our lives, it’s no surprise that when the dopamine system is out of balance it can contribute to many mental conditions. ( 35)Here are three of the most common conditions that have a dopamine connection. [TURN] What foods boost it? [TURN] So the way to increase central nervous system neurotransmitter levels is to provide proper amounts of the amino acid precursor. Bananas, especially ripe bananas, are an exceptional food for regulating dopamine because they have a high concentration of tyrosine. Other foods that increase dopamine through the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine include almonds, apples, watermelons, cherries, yogurt, beans, eggs and meats. It is important to note that dopamine foods alone generally do not have the therapeutic amino acid levels necessary to boost dopamine levels for someone experiencing major depressive disorder. To boost your levels of dopamine, dopamine rich foods may not be adequate. [TURN] How does the phenylalanine convert to tyrosine? [TURN] Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein. Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine. Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues. Section::::Structure. Catecholamines have the distinct structure of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups, an intermediate ethyl chain, and a terminal amine group. Phenylethanolamines such as norepinephrine have a hydroxyl group on the ethyl chain. [TURN] Can these drugs alleviate depression? [TURN] Predictions from the Catecholamine Theory of Mood The catecholamine theory makes the following predictions: Drugs wich destroy CAs should produce depression Drugs which increase CAs should alleviate depression Drugs used to test the Catecholamine Theory of Mood You now have a body of knowledge that can be used to test the catecholamine theory of mood. Drug Effect on the catecholamines DA and NA Predicted effect on depression Reserpine depletes CAs produce depression Tetrabenazine (TBZ) depletes CAs for a shorter length of time than reserpine produce depression Alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT)inhibits the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase - stops CA synthesis produce depression FLA-63 inhibits the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase - stops conversion of DA into NA. Theory does not make clear prediction Disulphiram inhibits the enzyme dopamine-beta-hydroxylase - stops conversion of DA into NA. Theory does not make clear prediction Pargyline inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAOI) alleviate depression Iproniazid inhibits the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAOI) alleviate depression Imipramine inhibits CA reuptake alleviate depression At first glance you might be tempted to use only those drugs that are associated with clear predictions - for example reserpine and pargyline - to test the theory. [TURN] Does this theory explain the cause of depression? [TURN] The British wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill , suffered from what he called \"\"Black Dog\"\", Churchill's name for depression The recent Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, may have experienced periods of depression. The Supplementary material section at the end of this page contains links to pages which discuss the impact of depression on the lives of these and other famous people. Point to ponder What part has madness played in human evolution? The Catecholamine Theory of Mood The catecholamine theory of mood was suggested by Schildraut and Kety. They suggest that: Depression is associated with a catecholamine deficiency in the brain Mania is associated with a catecholamine excess in the brain This proved to be a very fruitful theory because it was put forward at a time when there was an explosion in our knowlegde about where neurotransmitters were located in the brain, and the discovery of chemicals that interfered with the manufacture and actions of various neurotransmitters in the brain.

[TURN] No, I meant mania and depression. [TURN] A mild form in mania that does not require hospitalization is termed hypomania.’Major Depressive Disorders Major depressive disorder (often referred to as unipolar depression) contrasts with bipolar disorder, which is characterized by the occurrence of one or more manic or hypomanic episodes. The diagnosis of either will then fall into a category and a subcategory. What follows is a list of Common Mood Disorders: Depressive Disorders Major depressive disorders are on our list of mood disorders and are subcategorized into a single episode or recurrent episodes, in which two or more depressive episodes occur. The core symptoms of depression include: Sadness, apathy, unhappiness, apathy, anxiety. Pessimism, guilt, negative thinking, low motivation, poor concentration, suicidal thoughts. Lack of interest in personal appearance and hygiene, agitation, sluggish movements. Changes in appetite, constipation, loss of sex drive, sleep disturbances, menstrual cycle disruption. Manic Disorders The core symptoms of mania include: Elation, grandiosity, irritability. Pressure of thoughts, easily distractible with flighty ideas and poor judgement. Overactive speech. High levels of arousal and decreased need for sleep. \n",

[TURN] “You’re proud of your family name, but at the same time you have the consequences and the toll that takes on you.” Johnny Bench, who will turn 60 on Dec. 7, said he is sensitive to all of that. While Johnny is one of the most famous athletes in Cincinnati history and one of the most acclaimed athletes in American history, period, he could not care less that Bobby will never be another Johnny Bench. Athletically speaking, that is. “Bobby is just a fine young man,” Johnny said recently. “I couldn’t be prouder of him.” Bobby, who is 6-foot-7 and weighs 225 pounds, played some baseball when younger. Bobby said he got some of his height from his mother, Laura, who is tall at 6-foot. (Johnny is 6-1). Bobby mostly played first base in baseball. He was a decent athlete but, as a baseball player, was no Johnny Bench. Who could be? When Bobby was cut from St. Xavier baseball tryouts as both a freshman and a sophomore, he realized how impossible it could be to be who he was. \n",

Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3.

[TURN] A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? [TURN] Installing a heat pump can make a huge difference in your electricity bill by decreasing the cost of heating and cooling your home. A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. The average cost to install a heat pump ranges from $3,997 and $6,879 depending on the size of your home and type of heat pump. Since a geothermal heat pump requires underground installation, its installation costs will be more expensive than the costs for the air-source type. Though the cost of the heat pump and labor fees may be a significant investment, it can drastically reduce your energy consumption. Consider the following factors before installing a heat pump: On This Page: Heat Pump Installation Cost Considerations Heat Pump Prices Types of Heat Pumps How Does a Heat Pump Work? Benefits of a Heat Pump Heat Pump Tax Credits &amp; Rebates Installation Cost Considerations The difficulty associated with the excavation of the ground will affect the installation costs.

[TURN] If your home is currently heated by an inefficient heat source, for example oil, you’ll see much lower heating costs with a heat pump. The investment could pay for itself on the heating costs alone – and your air conditioning would be free! Our local Washington utilities offer rebates for heat pumps because of the real energy savings they provide. The heat pump is also one of the ‘greenest’ ways to heat and cool your home because it is powered off of renewable electricity. But don’t count air conditioners out just yet! The largest advantage is an air conditioner will give you a cool, comfortable home in the summer with less upfront cost than a heat pump. If you already have an energy efficient way to heat your home, such as a high efficiency gas furnace, then perhaps a heat pump will not yield a high enough return on investment. Or, if space is an issue then an air conditioner may be the right choice as they are more compact and fit into tighter spaces. [TURN] What are the pros and cons between a gas furnace and a heat pump? [TURN] Most of the heat pumps are convenient to use, and take up very little space. Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3. The sources used by heat pumps are limited, and are somewhat eco-friendly. [TURN] A heat pump seems very suitable for my house. How much does it cost to install one? [TURN] Installing a heat pump can make a huge difference in your electricity bill by decreasing the cost of heating and cooling your home. A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. The average cost to install a heat pump ranges from $3,997 and $6,879 depending on the size of your home and type of heat pump. Since a geothermal heat pump requires underground installation, its installation costs will be more expensive than the costs for the air-source type.

As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs.

[TURN] That’s great. What makes it so efficient? [TURN] It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium. \n",

[TURN] If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. \n",

[TURN] Geothermal vs. Air-Source Heat Pumps – Weighing the Pros and Cons Nov 8, 2013 | Blog The geothermal heat pump is quickly gaining popularity for efficient, eco-friendly heating. In fact, with the relatively warm ground temperatures around Houston, Ft. Bend, and Brazoria, geothermal may seem like the ideal heating and cooling system. As great as geothermal can be, though, there are times when a conventional air-source heat pump is preferable. Both geothermal and air-source heat pumps are more energy efficient than gas and oil furnaces. Beyond this, there are a number of important differences between these two types of heat pumps. Energy efficiency – Geothermal heat pump systems are more energy efficient. These heat pumps operate at between 300 to 600 percent efficiency even in the coldest weather. Air-source heat pumps, on the other hand, reach 175 to 300 percent efficiency even in milder winter weather. Upfront costs – Geothermal systems have higher purchase and installation costs. Lower energy costs let you recoup this investment over time, but if you’re planning to move soon, a less expensive air-source heat pump may be the wiser choice. [TURN] How many years will it take to recoup the investment? [TURN] Even with this significant front-end investment, geothermal systems are so energy-stingy that the payback period is remarkably brief. A study by the Air Force Institute of Technology calculated that it takes on average just seven to eight years to recoup costs. Your actual break-even point depends on local utility rates, excavation/drilling costs, how well your house is insulated, the efficiency of the model you choose, and what incentives your state or utilities provide. A good installer who's knowledgeable about heating and cooling as well as your local geology will be able to make those calculations for you. The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. \"\"It's a win-win arrangement,\"\" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities. [TURN] That’s great. What makes it so efficient? [TURN] It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium. [TURN] Cool science. But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones. [TURN] If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. [TURN] Tell me about AC systems. [TURN] An AC system has many components: compressor, condenser, receiver dryer, evaporator, and hoses. The compressor, the “heart” of the car’s air conditioning system works like a pump taking refrigerant, (R-12 in older cars, R-134a in 1995 and newer cars) and pressurizing it, passing it along to the evaporator. The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working. It is common for the internal parts of the compressor to come apart and disperse metallic debris throughout the system. Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there. For an AC compressor to work, it needs a clutch, bearing, and an electrical connector. The clutch is driven by a drive/serpentine belt, which engages the compressor when you switch on the AC. The clutch can burn or the bearing can fail. If the bearing or clutch have failed, it is recommended that the compressor be replaced. \n",

Why does your coach believe you have low ferritin? To answer your question: IF you are anemic AND your anemia is truly an iron deficiency anemia.

Get full blood workup and if you are anemic, then they will follow up with more tests to determine what is causing it. There are three main types of anemia. Lack of production; increased destruction, and blood loss. They'll check for blood loss related anemia by looking at a stool sample to see if you are suffering from internal bleeding. Lack of red cell production can have several causes, some of which are dietary like lack of iron, folic acid, b12, etc. But there are many, many, many other possible reasons that one may not be producing enough red blood cells. Ranging from liver problems or kidney problems or cancers or all kinds of less severe stuff. If your body is destroying too many red blood cells, it's probably some sort of hereditary disease. enzyme problems, sickle cell, all kinds of possibilities. If you have any kind of anemia that is not related to iron deficiency, taking iron won't do you any good at all and can be possibly harmfull. Don't listen to coaches: listen to doctors.this is your answer RE: How long after consistently taking iron pills should I see improvement?2/18/2012 12:04AM - in reply to rsbones Reply Return to Index Report Post I am going to disagree with some of the above posters. What your coach was probably referring to is that unless you specifically ask for a ferritin test, your doctor may not test for ferritin. Make sure your doctor tests for ferritin. Then, the doctor may say that you are \"\"fine\"\" with a ferritin level of say 16, and you are. You are not going to die, and you can walk around day to day easily. But if your ferritin level is that low, you will not be able to race effectively. Most recommend a ferritin level of 50-100. Ferritin can become too high (above 200) but I have never had an athlete get above 100 taking iron supplements. Regarding the time it takes to recover, I had an athlete hit rock bottom on Oct 15 (unable to complete a 5k race). She got tested, started taking hemaplex and floridex, stopped running, and was almost completely back to her original self by Nov 15.pr100RE: How long after consistently taking iron pills should I see improvement?2/18/2012 1:03AM - in reply to ironakafe Reply Return to Index Report Post Get serum ferritin and total blood tests.

Not to highjack this thread, but my last blood test showed a HCT of 38, normal iron, but a ferritin of 23. That blood test was a follow-up for a test where I had a HCT of 35, but no Iron test was done. The doctor didn't think Iron supplementation was warranted as everything was in the \"\"normal\"\" range, even if the HCT and ferritin were more or less at the very bottom of normal. Do you disagree with my doctors assessment? He couldn't care less about how fast I run.craig mcmahon RE: How long after consistently taking iron pills should I see improvement?2/18/2012 7:51AM - in reply to cyhawk Reply Return to Index Report Post This is only my personal experience, and I'm a snot-nosed 22yr old undergrad, but I've found that oftentimes, doctors will say \"\"you're fine\"\" when your serum ferritin is on the \"\"low end\"\" of normal. Being on the low end means that you function more or less fine and you probably wouldn't even notice if you weren't a serious runner. However, being on the low end of normal can really compromise your hardest efforts. Because I had an issue with actual anemia when I was much younger (heredity thing, nothing to do with running) I get my ferritin levels checked 2-3 times a year. When I'm running well, my level is always > 50. When my levels have been high 20s, low 30s, I've found my racing really goes to crap (and I mean like 'running a mile 20+ seconds slower than my PR' crap). At a serum ferritin level of ~30, I'm not anemic and a doctor would be correct in telling me I was \"\"fine.\"\" However, I know from experience that when I race, I am most certainly not fine. I should point out, though, that everyone has a different need for ferritin. I have a teammate who has had serious trouble with low iron and runs very well off a ferritin of 25 because that's very high for HIM. If your doctor won't do another iron test or give you the numbers, you can order a serum ferritin test (which includes other bloodwork) for like 40 bucks online. They'll send you a form you'll take to your nearest lab and the phlebotomist there will draw your blood, do the test, and post the results online. You don't need to be medically anemic to have sufficiently low iron to affect your running, but, on the other side, you don't want to run the risk of iron toxicity (potentially FATAL) either.

As a runner, you have a higher plasma volume than the average person. This high plasma volume dilutes hematocrit and hemoglobin levels and can make it appear that you are anemic when you aren't. An experienced doctor might be able to tell the difference. The best thing to do is get consistently tested so you can see where your levels normally are. Also consider getting your levels of vitamin B and TSH tested.rhctjyy RE: How long after consistently taking iron pills should I see improvement?2/18/2012 4:13PM - in reply to this is your answer Reply Return to Index Report Post I agree with this too. I was on the low end of the normal range and felt fine walking around. Really I felt ok running and racing too because it was all I had ever known.

Floridix (apparently I've been spelling it wrong) basically is liquid iron, and yes, I agree, it is the best way of taking iron. It should be taken with orange juice, to increase the rate of absorbtion. It should not be taken within 2 hours of milk (or any dairy product) as these inhibit absorbtion.this is your answer RE: How long after consistently taking iron pills should I see improvement?2/18/2012 6:04PM - in reply to ironakafe Reply Return to Index Report Postironakafe wrote: Also, does it matter what supplements you take specifically?

Tell him you think your anemic and you want all of that checked and the results mailed to you. I've had experiences where before I became very educated on the issue, my doc would say I'm fine despite touching the very end of the lowest part of the \"\"normal\"\" spectrum. An endurance athlete should supplement with iron unless there is a history of hematochromiosis (iron overload). Also there is only one Oral iron supplement that will actually build up in your system relatively quickly, and that is ferrochel. It's actually comparably to iron injections with the results. Be sure to take your iron with lots of vit c, it seriously increases the absorption rate of iron. But most importantly get your test results taken care of.go to a sports medicine doctor RE: How long after consistently taking iron pills should I see improvement?2/19/2012 9:57AM - in reply to ironakafe Reply Return to Index Report Post I think you should go see a doctor who practices in sports medicine. The family doctor one goes to doesn't necessarily understand the role of iron in exercise. Iron level affects individuals differently. In my case, when my ferritin was ~30 (all CBC numbers showed me I was a perfect human being) I suffered greatly from fatique and poor recovery, even a short easy run was too much. Everyday lfe was okay but I was so tired and needed naps during the day and that had never happened before. It took me a while (~3months) to start feeling normal after taking iron pills twice a day and when the ferritin level hit ~50, performance was just great. And Now I don't feel fatique at all after even the toughest workout I've ever done. Recovery was just very quick. My doctor did tell me to keep taking daily iron supplement in lower dosage.

Surprise, GP doc said iron was normal, my Gyn doc tested for ferritin and said I was at 3. So she put me on iron supplements, then after a 2nd test, found I was at only 14. She said to double the dose to 2x/day. It can be hard on stomach... I did research and found that taking iron at same time as Calcium can interfere with absorption (and that is exactly what I had been doing). Moral of the story - research what foods can interfere with iron absorption. So take the supplements, improve diet but be mindful of when you take your pill and what you take it with... Good luck! \"\n",

I was diagnosed with iron deficency anemia (my ferritin was at a 5) in August. I have been working very hard with a nutritionist to get my levels up through iron rich foods and iron supplements to no avail. It was finally decided that I either had an absorption issue or I was unable to hold the iron and I needed to see a hematologist and consider IV iron infusions. I had my first IV infusion last Friday (Venofer). I did really well the day of the infusion, but the next day I was experiencing severe pain in my kidney area on my right side. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this pain, if I should be concerned and notify the doctors about it or if it is just par for the course. I appreciate any feedback you might have. Thank you!Last edited by angelwhispers07; 04-16-2013 at 08:54 AM .

I requested iv infusion due to my horrible symptoms . I have lost a ton of hair and my dizziness has gotten really bad. My hematologist is only concerned if my H&h goes down.

I also managed to get my ferritin to 13, but then it went back down. I think that is why they felt I wasn't able to absorb or hold my iron - hence the infusions. The oral iron was wreaking havoc on my stomach, as well. I also have lost a ton of hair, am very light-headed, dizzy, chest pains upon exertion, muscle and body aches and black outs. I also just had a hysterectomy in December - I think they were counting on that fixing the problem. It obviously didn't. I am getting 3 infusions to start with, then an update with my doctor after labs to see if it's working. I will have to be retested periodically and be given a maintenance dose as needed. Are you seeing a hematologist? If not, I would ask my doctor for a referral. One thing I have learned this year with everything I have been through is you really have to advocate for yourself. Do not let them dismiss your symptoms and how you are feeling. You know your body better than anyone. Good luck and please let me know how you're doing!04-17-2013, 10:55 AM # 4karibarry Junior Member (female)Join Date: Nov 2012Location: West Bend, WI, USPosts: 17Re: IV Iron Infusion Side Effects Thanks! I had a uterine ablation in January. They think it was my monthly periods causing the anemia. I don't think it was. I have been losing hair for a couple years and and I only recently started my periods again from having an IUD. The starting of the periods did not help it at all but I know that wasn't the main issue.

My ferritin dropped to a 3. My hgb went from 13.4 to 11.2. Previously it was always around 14-15. My iron is 32. This all after tripling my iron intake.

So be prepared that you might need to sleep a lot. My second infusion was a no go. When the doctor got news of my brown urine and kidney pain, he didn't want to take any chances. He ordered some tests instead. They all came back in the normal range, though. So, I pick back up with the infusions next Friday. That means another Friday off from work!

I am sitting here doing my third and hopefully final infusion right now. My reaction for my second infusion was much less than my first and I started feeling so much better! Was thinking of you and wondered how you were doing with yours.08-30-2013, 11:18 AM # 10antiquetrader Newbie (female)Join Date: Aug 2013Posts: 3Re: IV Iron Infusion Side Effects Quote: Originally Posted by angelwhispers07Hi, my name is Lisa and I am new to the boards.

It was finally decided that I either had an absorption issue or I was unable to hold the iron and I needed to see a hematologist and consider IV iron infusions.

Thank you!I know what you mean, I too have this pain but mine is not very severe and it's gone now. I've had gallbladder issues before so I am attributing this pain to the gallbladder. A surgeon told me that because the gallbladder is not directly attached to pain receptors, you get pain in the darnest places like in your back. If you are concerned just call up the nurse and double check. It doesn't hurt to give them a quick call. I had my infusion yesterday and I feel better but I am not about to start running marathons yet. I am waiting for my surge of energy and I hope the infusion works. My hemoglobin was 8.9 before the infusion and I know it takes about 21 days for hemoglobin to regenerate. I was sleeping 3 days at a time before the infusion. It seems now I have more of a choice to lay down or not. My son said asked my husband yesterday why is she (me) so sick all the time? (Because I am sleeping a ton) My husband said she is not sick, just tired. I feel kinda guilty but on the other hand I am not having much of a choice on how I feel. I really need to sit down with my son and explain to him why is mama so tired.08-30-2013, 11:26 AM # 11antiquetrader Newbie (female)Join Date: Aug 2013Posts: 3Re: IV Iron Infusion Side Effects So I talked with my son and he told me that he though I was dying. Talking about a guilt trip!! I explained to him that mama was tired because of the lack of iron, but yesterday I got a bunch of iron. I said sometimes the way people can fight and not stop being friends, is the way that sometimes people can be sick and not die. Holy crap this is still sinking in. I need to work harder to connect with my son and reassure him. The anemia is taking a toll on my family and I didn't realize it. I am going to fix this right now.09-11-2013, 07:28 AM # 12Esther6Newbie (female)Join Date: Sep 2013Location: Sydney, Australia Posts: 1Re: IV Iron Infusion Side Effects Hi..

Our belly is where a lot of vital organs reside and like the cliche, better safe than sorry. My infusion experience: Day of (Day 1): headache that is equal to level of a migraine Day After (Day 2): body aches whole body (myalgia) ... like flu kind of aches Day 3: fatigue fatigue fatigue Day 4: fatigue fatigue fatigue Day 5: continued major fatigue, tried to go to work only to go home needing a ride - LOL Day 6: fatigue slightly improved from previous days Day 7: \"\"normal\"\" - the new normal, felt like I did prior to infusion (not like baseline before the anemia) My doctor was surprised and hypothesized that the work of my bone marrow on days 3 thru 6 may have caused me to be so tired. I did not expect fatigue greater than fatigue from anemia. I looked everywhere for normalization. I co-worker (a pharmacist) told me that his father in law is \"\"wiped out\"\" for 5 days after infusion. That was the first account that was similar to mine that validated my experience. Anemia is tricky. With 400 types and so many variables from our biochemistry, environment, and lifestyle, every person is different in what they experience. It's like a snowflake experience I think that is why I continuously hear \"\"Listen to your body\"\" as advice. That said, I suggest listening to your body, don't reason or rationalize the symptoms as just eating bad chinese ... tell your doctor. These boards are great for comparing experiences and getting tips and ideas for what to tell your doctor. A major part of treating any health issues is communication. Patients sometimes lack the fancy vocab or \"\"doctor speak\"\". Articulate your symptoms as clearly as possible so that it cues the doctor to ask the right diagnostic questions and order the right diagnostic tests. So for kidney pain ... precisely where? what type of pain ... continuous, sharp, dull, come-and-go, pulsating,? when did it start ... after treatment, during treatment, day after, after eating only, etc....?

I requested iv infusion due to my horrible symptoms . I have lost a ton of hair and my dizziness has gotten really bad. My hematologist is only concerned if my H&h goes down.

So I was just wondering what your circumstances were. Thanks!Hi karibarry - My H&H were low - which is why they tested my ferritin, but I managed to get them up into the \"\"normal low\"\" range. I also managed to get my ferritin to 13, but then it went back down. I think that is why they felt I wasn't able to absorb or hold my iron - hence the infusions. The oral iron was wreaking havoc on my stomach, as well. I also have lost a ton of hair, am very light-headed, dizzy, chest pains upon exertion, muscle and body aches and black outs. I also just had a hysterectomy in December - I think they were counting on that fixing the problem. It obviously didn't. I am getting 3 infusions to start with, then an update with my doctor after labs to see if it's working. I will have to be retested periodically and be given a maintenance dose as needed. Are you seeing a hematologist? If not, I would ask my doctor for a referral. One thing I have learned this year with everything I have been through is you really have to advocate for yourself. Do not let them dismiss your symptoms and how you are feeling. You know your body better than anyone. Good luck and please let me know how you're doing!04-17-2013, 10:55 AM # 4karibarry Junior Member (female)Join Date: Nov 2012Location: West Bend, WI, USPosts: 17Re: IV Iron Infusion Side Effects Thanks! I had a uterine ablation in January. They think it was my monthly periods causing the anemia. I don't think it was. I have been losing hair for a couple years and and I only recently started my periods again from having an IUD. The starting of the periods did not help it at all but I know that wasn't the main issue. I had labs drawn on Monday and I see my hematologist tomorrow to see if the ablation did anything and my 3 times daily iron helped bring my ferritin level of 5 up. We will see.

I don’t go too in depth in the answers, but I tried to give a direct answer and then link to a more in depth article on the topic to help you fully understand it. If you have any other questions you’d like to be added, changed, or are unsure about – please feel free to leave a comment below so I can fully explain, or make changes to the answers on this page. Best wishes, and to all the new people out there – good luck and happy dieting!Frequently Asked Questions Click any of the questions below and it will take you to the answer. How Long Does It Take To Get Into Ketosis? Where Can I Find Low Carb Recipes? How Should I Track My Carb Intake? Do I Need To Count Calories? Can I Eat Too Much Fat? How Much Weight Will I Lose? How Can I Tell if I Am In Ketosis? How Does Ketosis Work? What About Heart Attacks From All This Fat? What Are Macros and Should I Count Them? What Foods Can I Eat? Do You Have a Sample Menu I Can Look At? I Just Started and Feel Like Crap. What Should I Do? Constipation, What To Do? Can I Drink Alcohol On This Diet? I Stopped Losing Weight. What Can I Do? I Work Out, Should I Be Worried? What Supplements Should I Take? Common Terms and What They Mean How Long Does It Take To Get Into Ketosis? A ketogenic diet is not a diet that you can whimfully choose to go on and off of at any point. It takes time for your body to adjust and go into a state known as ketosis. This process? Anywhere from 2 – 7 days, depending on your body type, activity levels, and what you’re eating. The fastest way to get into ketosis is to exercise on an empty stomach, restrict your carbohydrate intake to 20g or less per day, and be vigilant with your water intake. To improve the rate at which you enter ketosis, there is a method called Fat Fasting. I’ve written an article on Fat Fasting on a Ketogenic Diet and everything involved with it. Make sure that if you use this method, it is only for a few days, otherwise it can bring harm to you. Where Can I Find Low Carb Recipes? Everywhere on the internet! There’s recipes on almost every health website nowadays, and a quick Google of what you want will definitely help you out. You can even convert high carb recipes that use sugar or fruits in them to low carb recipes with artificial sweeteners or by getting rid of the fruit. This website even has tons of recipes you can check out and get ideas from, ranging from breakfast to dinner and even dessert. Check out the Keto Recipes section to get inspired in the kitchen!How Should I Track My Carb Intake? The most common ways to track your carbs is through My Fitness Pal and their mobile app. You cannot track net carbs on the app, although you CAN track your total carb intake and your total fiber intake. To get your net carbs, simply subtract your total fiber intake from your total carb intake. I have written an article on How to Track Carbs on My Fitness Pal. Others choose to use Fat Secret. This is an app I am unfamiliar with, although I do know that you can track your net carbs. The choice is totally up to you and up to your own free will to decide. Do I Need To Count Calories? At the end of the day, calories matter. Calories in/calories out is such a simple equation that it will never stand true to any one person. Metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and food sensitivities will also play a part in all of this. Your job? Well, to eat properly. Never go too far into a deficit, and never snack on foods that are considered “bad”. With a ketogenic diet you rarely have to worry about calories because the fats and proteins will fill you up and keep you full for a long period of time. But, if you exercise, you sometimes have to be vigilant. With exercise comes a greater calorie deficit, and you must eat to make up for it. I’ve written an article on calories and why they should still be considered. Can I Eat Too Much Fat? In short, yes, you can eat too much fat. In the above question, I talked about calories and how they’re still important for us. In the end, we still need to be at a caloric deficit for us to lose weight. Eating too much fat will push you over that calorie deficit, and turn it into a calorie surplus. While most people will find it hard to actually overeat on a low carb high fat diet, it is still possible. You can use the keto calculator to calculate your macros and see how much fats, proteins, and carbs you should be eating a day. Keep in mind when you fill this out, you can edit the values of your protein and carbs (and should, depending on your activity levels). If you have any questions on this, please let me know in the comments. How Much Weight Will I Lose? The amount of weight you lose is totally dependent on you. Obviously adding exercise to your regimen will speed up your weight loss. Cutting out things that are common “stall” causers is also a good thing. Artificial sweeteners, dairy, wheat products and by products (wheat gluten, wheat flours, and anything with an identifiable wheat product in it). Water weight loss is common when you first start a low carb diet. Ketosis has a diuretic effect to it that can cause many pounds of weight loss in only a few days. While I hate being the bearer of bad news, this isn’t fat. But on a side (and more positive) note, that shows that your body is starting to adjust itself into a fat burning machine!There’s a huge list of keto-friendly recipes for you to choose from, go check them out!How Can I Tell if I Am In Ketosis? The most common way is to use Ketostix. They can be picked up at your local pharmacy usually. Keep in mind, though, that they’re incredibly inaccurate. Normally, they will give you an idea as to if you’re in ketosis or not. Any pink or purple on the stick shows that ketones are being produced in your body. Darker colors usually mean that you’re dehydrated and the ketone levels are more concentrated in your urine. Ketostix measure the amount of acetone in your urine, which are mostly unused ketones. The ketone that is used by your body and brain for energy is called Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and is not measured by Ketostix. For a more reliable and accurate way to measure your ketone levels, you must use a blood ketone meter. These will show you the proper amount of ketones in your blood, and aren’t as easily changed through hydration (or lack thereof). If you have a blood ketone meter, this is what the readings mean: Light Ketosis: 0.5 mmol/L – 0.8 mmol/LMedium Ketosis: 0.9 mmol/L – 1.4 mmol/LDeep Ketosis (best for weight loss): 1.5 mmol/L – 3.0 mmol/LIf you want to learn more, consider reading our in-depth article on measuring ketosis >How Does Ketosis Work? In a nutshell, ketosis is a state that our body enters when we don’t eat carbohydrates. It’s a way for our body to use fats (body fats included) as the primary energy we need. It’s not only healthy for us, it’s actually more efficient for our brains to use. How do we get that energy from the fats? Well that “ketosis” state we are in allows our liver to break fats down into molecules called ketones. Those ketones provide the energy we need. How does that all fall into weight loss? Through calorie deficit, we aren’t actually eating enough energy for our body to live, so we have to dig into our own fat stores to get the energy we need. I’ve written a much more in depth article about Ketones, Ketosis and How It All Works that you can check out if you’re interested in the science behind it all. What About Heart Attacks From All This Fat? The main three fat groups we eat are saturated fats, polyunsaturated fats, and monounsaturated fats. The general consensus used to be that saturated fats were terrible for us and there was a clear link between saturated fats and heart disease. In recent years, though, saturated fats have shown to not only NOT cause heart attacks, but improve cholesterol levels. You can eat them without worry. Polyunsaturated fats are a bit more tricky. There are 2 sides of the story here. Processed polyunsaturated fats (like margarine spreads and vegetable oils) are terrible for us, and usually include trans fats. They DO have a causation effect with heart disease and should be avoided. However, there are naturally occurring polyunsaturated fats in foods like fish, which are great for us and will improve cholesterol. It’s your job to seek out the healthy fats and eliminate the unhealthy fats. Last but not least, there’s monounsaturated fats. These are pretty known to be “healthy” and are generally accepted as so. Olive oil is a pirmary example of something that is more proportionately a monounsaturated fat – being healthy for us and lowering our cholesterol. I’ve written a more in depth look at Cholesterol and Fats on Keto that you can read at your own leisure. What Are Macros and Should I Count Them? Macros is a condensed term for the word macronutrients. The “big 3” macronutrients are fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. As mentioned before, calories still matter – and it’s best you track all of them at the beginning. This not only gets you in a good habit, but also allows you to see how you are doing. You’d be surprised at how much we lie to ourselves, and how many unknown carbs can creep into our diet. Tracking your macros also helps you if you come to a stall in your weight loss. You can pinpoint and nitpick at things in your diet that could well be causing this. When you track your macros, make sure you think in terms of GRAMS. Don’t think in terms of percentages. I see tons of new people thinking “well I did 5% carbs, 20% protein, and 75% fat – perfect” but that isn’t the case. Grams give a much more accurate description of what you’re eating, so use those!Keep in mind that if you’re off on your macros by a bit, it’s not a huge deal. You have wiggle room to go up or down by 10-15g of fats and proteins, in most cases. If some days you go over, and some days you’re under, don’t freak out. As long as you’re keeping your calories in check and they’re not too far in a deficit, you’re fine!I’ve written a more in depth article on What Macronutrients Are and why they are important to us. What Foods Can I Eat? It’s a very common question to ask what you can eat. The main thing is to stay away from carbs. In a nutshell, that’s sugars, breads, pastas, and rice. It might sound so simple when you look at it that way, but it’s not all that simple. Potato chips, tomato sauce, and even salad dressings can have carbs in them. Even vegetables have carbs in them, but they are a necessary part of our diet, and that’s why we are allowed up to 30g of carbs a day – wiggle room, if you will, for some small amounts of residual carbohydrates from foods we need. I’ve put together a small list of keto-friendly foods to get you started on building a shopping list and getting healthier!Do You Have a Sample Menu I Can Look At? This is a very hard question to answer. For every single person, their dietary menus will change. The amount of calories, fats, proteins, and carbs change per person and one menu wouldn’t be able to accompany or satisfy them. I have, however, put together a 7 day meal plan that is based off of my own macros. You can view the 30 Day Keto Diet Plan to get an idea of what I eat on a regular basis, and how it all plays into calculating your macros. What your job here is, is to make it fit into your own macros. That means adjusting the portion sizes to make the calories higher or lower. Adjusting fat content (taking away cheese, adding cheese), adjusting protein values (mine is pretty high, so most of you will need to take away), and only adjusting the carb count slightly. I think the carb count is quite good in the meal plan, but you could do with adding some vegetables if you don’t take a multivitamin, though. I Just Started and Feel Like Crap. What Should I Do? A very common happening when people start a ketogenic diet is getting headaches and “brain fogginess”. Since ketosis has a diuretic effect on our bodies, we end up peeing a lot more than usual. Factor that in with our bodies burning up the lasting glycogen stores, and you have yourself a big disaster on your hands. You’re peeing out electrolytes and you need to replace them. Stay hydrated and eat salt. Broth, salty foods like bacon and deli meat, or salted nuts. These are good things to eat and drink while you’re transitioning into ketosis, and are good things to help keep you sane and functional. I’ve written a more in depth article on the beginning symptoms of keto flu. Constipation, What To Do? It’s fairly common for people starting out on keto to have irregular bowel movements. Below is a list of common advice given to people for constipation or bowel movement problems. Take a Magnesium Supplement Drink Plenty of Water Eat One Tbsp. of Coconut Oil Stop Eating Nuts (if you do)Eat More Fibrous Vegetables Try Eating Chia Seeds or Flax Seeds Try Coffee or Tea Can I Drink Alcohol On This Diet? Alcohol can be consumed while on keto, but you must be wary. Those hidden carbs can creep in again. The main takeaway point is to go after liquor. Wine, beer, and cocktails all have carbohydrates in them. Clear liquor is your best bet, but make sure you are steering clear of flavored liquors, as they can hold carbs in them. I’ve written an article on keto and alcohol so you can get a more in depth idea on what’s going on and what you can drink. I Stopped Losing Weight. What Can I Do? Weight loss plateaus happen to everyone at least once. There’s a number of things that could be the problem but I will keep this one short. You can try a different number of methods that may help you out – ranging from cutting certain foods out of your diet to changing your eating patterns through intermittent fasting or fat fasting. Here’s a list of common suggestions that are normally advised to people that aren’t losing weight: Cut Out Dairy Up Your Fat Intake Decrease Your Carb Intake Stop Eating Nuts Stop Eating Gluten Cut Out Artificial Sweeteners Look for Hidden Carbs Begin Cutting Processed Food from Diet Switch to Measuring Instead of Weighing I’ve written an article, where you can read more about weight loss plateaus and how to break through them. I Work Out, Should I Be Worried? There’s 2 types of people that work out. People who run and people who lift weights. If you’re someone who does a lot of cardio – running, biking, marathons, or the like, then you don’t need to worry. Studies show that aerobic training (endurance training) isn’t effected by low carbohydrate diets. There’s a more in depth article on training on a ketogenic diet that I wrote. Now, the story changes if you lift weights. You have to know your end goal here. As a short answer, carbohydrates do help your performance and also help with recovery of muscles. That means faster gains, and better strength performance in your training sessions. There’s two routes you can take here – TKD and CKD. TKD is a targeted ketogenic diet, where you’re intaking just enough carbs before your workout to knock you out of ketosis for the duration of your workout. How it works is that you supply a glycogen source to your muscle to use, and then once it is used up after you finish your workout you will resume a ketotic state. You can read more on the targeted ketogenic diet in the article I wrote. CKD is a cyclical ketogenic diet, and is also known as a more advanced technique. This shouldn’t be used if you’re new to keto, or new to training. It’s more for bodybuilding and competitors that are wanting to stay on a ketogenic diet while still building muscle in their intense workouts. In this method, you stay on a regular ketogenic diet for a period of time (usually 5 days) and then do what is known as a carb-up for a period of time (usually 2 days, or the weekend). In a CKD, you are essentially replenishing all of your glycogen stores for all the training you’ll do for the rest of the week, and your goal is to deplete that glycogen. You can read more on a cyclical ketogenic diet in the article I wrote. What Supplements Should I Take? Sometimes it’s common for people to get cramps or just not feel “right” after starting a ketogenic diet. Some supplements that are commonly suggested for people include: Multivitamin for Women Multivitamin for Men Magnesium Supplement Vitamin B Complex Vitamin D Supplement Potassium Supplement Always check with your doctor before introducing vitamins into your diet. Common Terms and What They Mean AS: This means Artificial Sweetener. Normally used to sweeten our foods with a reduced or zero carb count. BPC: This is known as Ketoproof Coffee. It’s normally butter, oil, and coffee mixed together with an emulsion blender to help up your fat content and give you a “full” feeling for the morning. Here is a common recipe for ketoproof coffee and the health benefits behind it. Fat Bomb: These are generally packed full of oils and fats to up our fat content for the day. Some people have trouble keeping up with their fat content so they make a fat bomb to help them out. They don’t HAVE to be sweet – you can make them to your own liking and even make a salty version too. Here is a common fat bomb recipe for you to use. HWC: This stands for Heavy Whipping Cream. Just ordinary cream that, for a lot of us, is a daily staple in our coffee and diet. IR: This relates to insulin resistance. This is where the body’s cells cannot properly respond to the insulin hormone. LCHF: Low Carb High Fat, the whole point of this diet!MCT: Medium Chain T riglyceride. These help boost your metabolism and are quite unique. When they are metabolized, they’re turned into ketones straight away. SF: This means Sugar Free. There’s a range of sugar free foods that a lot of people consume, normally containing artificial sweeteners. WOE: Way of Eating. This is just a term used to reference their own diet.specialty itemscooking accessorieskitchen productssupplement necessities Turn your body into a FAT BURNING MACHINE with our exclusive meal plans!SEE WHAT'S INSIDERELATED ARTICLESTop 10 Foods for the Ketogenic Diet Share Your Keto Success Story Is Coconut Oil Actually Good for You?

How Long Does It Take To Get Into Ketosis? Where Can I Find Low Carb Recipes? How Should I Track My Carb Intake? Do I Need To Count Calories? Can I Eat Too Much Fat? How Much Weight Will I Lose? How Can I Tell if I Am In Ketosis? How Does Ketosis Work? What About Heart Attacks From All This Fat? What Are Macros and Should I Count Them? What Foods Can I Eat?

I Work Out, Should I Be Worried? What Supplements Should I Take? Common Terms and What They Mean How Long Does It Take To Get Into Ketosis? A ketogenic diet is not a diet that you can whimfully choose to go on and off of at any point. It takes time for your body to adjust and go into a state known as ketosis. This process? Anywhere from 2 – 7 days, depending on your body type, activity levels, and what you’re eating. The fastest way to get into ketosis is to exercise on an empty stomach, restrict your carbohydrate intake to 20g or less per day, and be vigilant with your water intake. To improve the rate at which you enter ketosis, there is a method called Fat Fasting. I’ve written an article on Fat Fasting on a Ketogenic Diet and everything involved with it. Make sure that if you use this method, it is only for a few days, otherwise it can bring harm to you. Where Can I Find Low Carb Recipes? Everywhere on the internet! There’s recipes on almost every health website nowadays, and a quick Google of what you want will definitely help you out. You can even convert high carb recipes that use sugar or fruits in them to low carb recipes with artificial sweeteners or by getting rid of the fruit. This website even has tons of recipes you can check out and get ideas from, ranging from breakfast to dinner and even dessert. Check out the Keto Recipes section to get inspired in the kitchen!How Should I Track My Carb Intake? The most common ways to track your carbs is through My Fitness Pal and their mobile app. You cannot track net carbs on the app, although you CAN track your total carb intake and your total fiber intake. To get your net carbs, simply subtract your total fiber intake from your total carb intake. I have written an article on How to Track Carbs on My Fitness Pal. Others choose to use Fat Secret. This is an app I am unfamiliar with, although I do know that you can track your net carbs. The choice is totally up to you and up to your own free will to decide. Do I Need To Count Calories? At the end of the day, calories matter. Calories in/calories out is such a simple equation that it will never stand true to any one person. Metabolic disorders, endocrine disorders, and food sensitivities will also play a part in all of this. Your job? Well, to eat properly. Never go too far into a deficit, and never snack on foods that are considered “bad”. With a ketogenic diet you rarely have to worry about calories because the fats and proteins will fill you up and keep you full for a long period of time. But, if you exercise, you sometimes have to be vigilant. With exercise comes a greater calorie deficit, and you must eat to make up for it.

You are a skinny guy trying to gain muscle : going to gym an hour everyday ( Let's assume 5 days a week , this is also a bit too much for a beginner). So here you are at my stage. If you take your diet seriously along with proper rest and a planned workout schedule.. I would say it will take 3-4 months for you to see a noticeable change. as the saying goes it takes 4 weeks for you to see some changes, 8weeks for your friends to see the changes, 12 weeks for the rest of the world to see the change. According to me the above saying is a motivational quote kinda thing. Coz once you cross that 12 week barrier. .. Then there's no stopping. You will love pumping weights and you will grow stronger both physically and mentally 2. You are trying to lose fat : well this situation is tricky. You see the real measure of how much fat you lose and how much muscle you gain is not dependent on your body weight. so don't worry about your body weight, because as you are hitting gym. .. You are building muscles. I would say dont miss your cardio, don't ingest unwanted fat , decrease your carb intake ( diet is 70% of the magic, 30% is workout). And don't be harsh on yourself. Give it 3-4 months. Well for some motivation I will say I have seen guys who weighed 80 kgs+ reduce their wt to around 65kgs in naval academy plus they got abs : D So don't give up.

Realistically, you should give it like two weeks . This is sooner than you would expect (I think) but enough time that you still need to apply yourself consistently for the whole period of time. You do need to do a few things correctly though: You should be eating a good diet that is conducive to your workouts. If making big diet changes is difficult for you, try to at least (1) stop eating sugary foods/candy (including soft drinks) and (2) avoid carbs at dinner or later. Exercise hard enough so that you are sweating, if you're doing cardio. Use weights that are heavy enough so that your last two reps are \"\"to exhaustion\"\" (you are just barely able to complete them) - the only reps that count are the last two; the ones that come before it are just to tire the muscle out to the point where you are pushing your limit to do the last two.209k Views · View Upvoters Your response is private.

Answered Jun 8, 2011 I don't agree with any answer already given, because it is impossible to judge what is best for you without knowing your body composition, your targets, your training preferences, and so on. So please don't listen to whoever is giving you any suggestion, either in training or diet, without knowing nothing about you - they are much probably just projecting their own experiences. Sticking to the answer to your question, only one is of course possible: it depends. It depends heavily from: Your diet. Diet not in the sense of restriction but in the broader sense, your food (and liquids) intake. How you train. First of all, lots of people waste huge amount of time in the gym. Most probably yourself too, if you really go every day and you spend one hour there. Also, secondarily, how you spend this time is important. Your starting level. If you are a sportive person who has always spent some time weekly for instance playing some team sport, etc., then you will have different results than the guy that never did sport in their life. I do suggest what Tim Ferris do, that is: treat training like a drug. Too few of it, and has no effect, too much of it - or the wrong one used - and you have adverse reactions and possibly miss your targets. As you would ask your doctor for a drug's prescription, ask someone who has experience about a diet and training personalized for your.57.9k Views · View Upvoters Your response is private.

Answered Jun 4, 2011 · Author has 264 answers and 564k answer views To be honest, I wouldn't start by going to the gym for an hour daily. If you're working out intensively enough, an hour every day will quickly make you feel exhausted and defeated. And if you're not working out intensively enough you're learning a bad habit of not doing things properly. Much better to start out by aiming for 2-3 times spaced out around the week, and then see whether you feel like doing more. Even once you're fully fit, you shouldn't do heavy resistance training on the same muscle groups more than about 3 times a week. And yes, you will begin to feel a difference after the first session. You may not like it at first, but if you stick at it, by about the second or third week the difference how you feel will be quite marked and definitely for the better. Visible changes such as fat loss and/or muscle growth may take a bit longer.61.6k Views · View Upvoterspromoted by Better Help Online Counseling Are you struggling with depression?

Start Now at betterhelp.com Vinay Deshpande, worked at Aditi Technologies Answered Jun 8, 2015The most important thing is the sheer amount of satisfaction that we get when we go to the gym. And never expect your body to change instantly . Every \"\"body\"\" is different . A person who sweats a lot has a great chance of toning down his body a bit faster then the person perspires less. When u work out your body starts to feel light and u start to feel fresh. The most important thing is that the blood circulation in your body improves which will result in honing your body internally. Generally, the first few days of the gym usually requires our body to get acquainted with the changes . After 2- 3 weeks of your regular exercise u will notice certain changes in terms of the freshness in your body u will automatically start feeling positive about yourself . If u reach this point where your body and your mind both start working towards one goal the changes start and it does not take much time after that to get a body that u want. Along with all this , a good diet plan given by your gym trainer is very essential for u to follow. That also plays a very crucial role .

Considering you workout for an hour daily and follow some of the diet tips (which are with respect to your requirements), because its tough to adapt totally new diet plan and take time to settle. This is what I observed,Week 1-2 will dip you in a muscular pain, where you wont be able to walk properly (after legs), once you get use to it and settle down with forms of exercise, your capacity will increase too after a month, which will need more energy and stamina, which will lead to drastic increase in your appetite, at this moment of time your body will be protein deficient which is extremely necessary for the recovery of sore muscles. Till three months, you will feel the bulking and muscle growth on your own and from other people too, but hereafter saturation starts (comparatively less muscle gaining than the previous three months or so). Your capacity of weight training will get stuck. Diet will be constant you wont be able to eat more. And then you will stop hearing the compliments from people. Yes, you got it. Time to work harder than before. Just follow the basic of workouts, sleep well, eat well, work hard.

I just started training with a guy who hasn't been to the gym or exercised much in 5 years. I've noticed a very fast increase in both his coordination and strength. His balance is much better, he doesn't puke in the middle of workouts, and he's actively asking for more weight. We are on our 3rd week. We lift 3-4 days/week, he bikes ~30 minutes ( real bicycle out doors ) on days we don't lift. He's sore after every workout.

I am now on a much bigger dose, from GP although she is horrified! All these years, I never knew about asking for the % . Incidentally , my B12 and Foliates are very high in range.

I have been on it for years. I think it may be a case of try different treatment until find one that suits. Best wishes,Jackie Replypoing4 years ago I reckon if your ferritin isn't going up then it's because you are lacking something else that is needed for your body to use the iron. Zinc and vitamin B2 are two of the possibilities that you could try taking. Copper deficiency causes anaemia that looks like iron deficiency but doesn't respond to iron supplements. The final option is that you have very high levels of inflammation that are causing your body to reject additional iron. In that case you should stop taking the iron and try to do things that help reduce inflammation. I don't know which of these things applies in your case, and you should discuss it with a doctor. If you've been trying to raise your levels for two years without success, then it's not simple iron deficiency and its time to try a different approach.5 likes Reply Jackie in reply to poing4 years ago Hi My problems is due to very bad absorption, due to severe autoimmune Pancretitis,but it does show how important the % is.

As long as my normal iron levels are ok, they seem happy. Trouble is, I have very bad periods, they leave me totally wiped out, and weak as a kitten. I just dont know what to do anymore. I feel so overwhelmed, doctor doesn't take me seriously, and I have been having heart problems too, so feel they cant cope with more that one thing at a time. I was only there 2 weeks ago, to discuss all this new medication they want me on. Aspirin, bisoprolol, a statin and an angina spray. I have only taken the aspirin so far as want to wait until the results of the scans before I start all those heavy drugs (man!) lol Replypoing in reply to tingles4 years ago Oh no! I am not at all surprised that you feel overwhelmed, weak and wiped out. I had really low iron about three years ago, and my ferritin was 12 after a year on being on iron supplements. I know how it feels!Your heavy periods probably have a lot more to answer for than you realise. Iron deficiency makes them worse, so it's kicking a lady when she's already down. Thankfully I found a way to sort out my heavy periods. When I had my copper IUD removed, I went from 8-day periods down to 2. That made more of a difference to my iron levels l than anything else I've done, as my ferritin then shot up to the dizzy heights of 22. Are doctors doing anything about your bleeding? The mirena coil is supposed to dramatically reduce bleeding, and even though I don't like hormonal contraception, if nothing else worked then I would consider it. If the inorganic iron supplements aren't raising your ferritin, then you really do need to do something different. Iron is strongly linked with heart disease, and I had chest pain from taking too much iron in the beginning, which I've never had before or since. I had to cut my dose right back... a single sachet of Spatone was all that I could manage. I can't possibly know if iron is connected to your own heart problems/angina, and I don't want to scare you, but it's something to be aware of because I think it's a possibility. I've come across a heme iron supplement from the US called Proferrin, which apparently works much better than the inorganic ones, and will raise iron much faster. The absorption mechanism is different because it's haem iron. I haven't tried it myself, but I have heard good things about it. There's another one called lactoferrin, which is derived from milk, but is a (non-casein) protein that latches onto minerals and is then absorbed and studies seem to suggest that it works fairly well for fixing iron deficiency. The other thing to consider is eating liver at least once a week (or if you can't stomach that, liver tablets). It's chock full of so many nutrients, but especially iron and copper. That's what I do now. Oh and I have blackstrap molasses too. A good diet - preferably without wheat/gluten - and some B vitamins might also help. I hope you can find something that works for you.

High iron is never a good condition for cancer patients for, as we know, cancer likes iron just as it does sugar. My levels had been normal before two blood transfusions that I needed at the very end of nine months of chemo and radiation. Do they warn you that transfusions can raise your ferritin levels? No, of course. Only my integrative doctor bothered to test for ferritin levels. NOW the question is how to bring them down ASAP. My doctor has suggested lactoferrin (ONE of the elements in why protein, by the way; Life Extension now makes a whey powder that's augmented by extra lactoferrin. )However, I think I have read that IP-6 can also bind iron and remove it from the body. Do all of you know how your ferritin levels are doing? Have any of you had to find ways to lower them?

Further, since cancer cells are also wandering around in the blood, some of them will be gotten rid of with the drawn blood. ANd, no, I don't know how one might convince a doctor to go along with this, but you may have a reasonable doc who sees the logic herein. Sometimes one must move back to move forward in health. ANyway my love and thoughts are with you, thanks so much for the emails.

I had a friend who had haemochromatosis (excessive iron accumulation). He used to have regular blood letting to reduce his serum ferritin. He is still alive today 30 years after diagnosis and a few joint replacements along the way. I have always wondered about donating blood for the same reason. Would that not serve the same purpose? Do you have blood banks over there? In Australia it is a voluntary thing although everyone is thoroughly screened before donation. I have also read that rice bran binds to iron. I discovered this when my mum became anaemic from eating too much rice bran. There is research about this on the web. Nice to hear from you again on this discussion board. I admire your view on many topics Claudia.

I don't know for certain. There may be a way that the blood is filtered to sort out just the plasma. If I can give blood, I will. I had just assumed not but had never in fact looked into it further. Will certainly try the rice bran in the meantime. Thanks. I do try to be helpful, often times ending up the recipient of numerous slings and arrows. But. ah well, in the end. for me it matters little what slights I suffer, if some little thing I have posted has saved a life or made other lives perhaps longer and more enjoyable. I finally realized, that I have lived a Pollyannaesk existence, only previously having been surrounded with love and kindness. There are so very many wonderful, caring women on this board.

My CPR has always been less than .01, which is exactly where Keith Block wants to see it, but there are other indicators of inflammation. Of course, as Claudia points out, I can't donate blood but perhaps I can shed a bit of it; will ask about this. In the meantime, I'll just try lactoferrin and/or IP 6. Is anyone else taking IP 6? There seem to be increasingly good reports on its use for cancer treatment, prevention of remission, even use during chemo. It not only chelates iron but apparently boosts NK cells and may also--get this--discourage metastasis. If any of you want some clinical articles about it, will be happy to append. No negative effects have been reported. Yes, transfusions can lead to high ferritin levels, but so may another phenomenon: Keith Block says that he has occasionally seen high ferritin levels after conclusion of treatment signalling the death of many cancer cells that haven't yet been shed from the body; I can only hope THAT is why my levels are a bit high.

Rosey Log in or register to post commentscalifornia_artist Posts: 865Joined: Jan 2009Feb 28, 2012 - 9:29 am Rosey, et all--Woke this morning to thoughts of excess iron on my mind. Always in detective mode, i wondered about the iron --Copper also-let loose on the body as cancer cells die as a result of chemo. Reminded me that I had read that it is always better to make cancer cells kill themselves, as in apoptosis, that ever so fancy word for suicide,as opposed to us slaying them through any means, seems each way has a different impact on the liver's job. Well, now that I am becoming more awake, I recall that it is the p53 gene that controls apoptosis, and we are unfortunately in a distinguished group that has our vitally important p53 gene, the silencer, silenced itself, and therein lies the bane of our existence, the key to our woes. Were it to be turned on, it would inform our cancer cells that they were really messed up and needed to die post (e) haste. So, our doctors, armed with that knowledge, should offer along with the chemo, a bit of blood drawing, more than for testing, but less than what would do further damage. Excesses of not only iron but copper, and simply the detris (whatever that word is for debris, ah, it's debris, of dead cells), also taxes our livers. I always relate it to having the oil changed. Every car needs an oil change now and then and this is then for us. They might inform us of the iron/copper issue and suggest we drink tea with meals, eat foods low in iron and copper and some cilantro along with oodles of glasses of water, to reduce the fuel to our cancer cells. I was working on this comment by my friend, Rosey, whose comments I respect greatly. \"\"Keith Block says that he has occasionally seen high ferritin levels after conclusion of treatment signalling the death of many cancer cells that haven't yet been shed from the body; I can only hope THAT is why my levels are a bit high. \"\"This also supports a theory (hypothesis) I have concerning delivery times based on the manner in which antibiotics are given. A patient is always instructed to take antibiotics on a regular basis because, if the body and the particular bacterium are allowed to react to what is killing them during lag time they can become resistant to the antibiotic. Well, I thought the same is probably true about cancer cells, that given that inital onslaught of chemo and then the three weeks delay, they do morph and figure out how to fend off the next attack, and continue to do so during each rest period. Along this line of thought then, if chemo were given in much much more frequent periods and in a lesser amount, wouldn't they not not only have less time to morph during, but also wouldn't it lessen the burden on the body as they are killed off, and wouldn't the, your, mine anybody'a body be then able to concentrate on strengthening the immune system? I'm just conjecturing here. Any thoughts? Aside from that perhaps I should wake up a bit more before trying to convey thoughts from my brain to yours. Does anyone know how often cancer cells reproduce? With bacterium it must be mere hours, cancer cells? That would be very important information to have in hand. I do rather wish we had more input in things that happened to us during this journey, or could at least feel listened to when we question the reasoning behind procedures and perhaps suggest other options than the norm, such as having blood taken to get rid of some of the dead cancer cell debris. There is a fine line that needs to be walked and I'm feeling that it's not clearly insight, yet. So, off to get warm.

            "Text: Share August 30, 2013Q: Can’t Boost My Iron! What should I do? Hi Lauren,As an athlete I’ve struggled to manage my ferritin and it has begun to get frustrating. There was a while I was getting a blood panel done at least every 6months, mostly to track our athlete specific trends for our team physiologist. Two years ago now my ferritin took a nose dive from 72 down to 30 and has since then continued to slowly dwindle. Currently at a pale 19. The first dive happened after I moved away from home (where I ate game meat regularly) to living in the Olympic training center, so I could see the dietary link to the decline. However since then I have been living outside a cafeteria setting, taking periodized iron supplements ( recently trying the liquid kind) but my stores just keep sliding. I’m wondering if you have found any strong link with gluten? My diet is primarily based on vegetables (leafy greens, etc), hearty grains, and lean red meat. With a bunch of endurance athletes in the house we eat pretty well but we do eat a bit of (very gluten-y) bread…. I guess I’m grasping for straws… help? Corrine A: Corrine,Mmmmmm….oysters….in a can. A couple iron rich foods you could try to get an extra boost are clams, muscles, and oysters. They are much higher than beef! 20 small clams has 295% DV of iron compared to 35% DV in a 6oz steak! You could either eat them for dinner, or have a tin of smoked clams with crackers for a snack or at lunch. They are magic. The tins are cheap and portable and loaded with iron. Some people think they are disgusting, but I like ’em, kind of. Well I like the results When my iron is low I’m desperate, and I’ll eat anything besides liver and onions. That shit is nasty. What about wheat? There are links between wheat and iron for some people, but from what I understand it’s only an issue when pairing the iron with wheat at a given meal. If you have a turkey sandwich for lunch and then a steak and potatoes for dinner, that shouldn’t matter. If you have celiac disease, then it’s a different story. Gluten could definitely be the cause of your declining iron in that case, and it would also be causing a decline in lots of other vitamin and mineral stores as well. I’d get a blood test for celiac or gluten intolerance before sacrificing your diet unnecessarily. Bread is just too damn good. But yeah, don’t eat it with your iron if you’re having trouble keeping the iron up. Too much fiber can interfere with iron absorption too. This is the secret culprit for most athletes who are eating iron but still experiencing low blood levels. A lot of athletes inadvertently make it harder and harder to absorb iron because they are trying so hard to get raw veggies and whole grains in, but fiber gets things moving quickly through the system, and you can have too much of a good thing. Less time in the intestines means less time for vitamins and minerals to absorb. If you have frequent loose stools, this probably applies to you. The daily recommendation for fiber is 25-35 g per day. Athletes trying to be really healthy often eat double that, especially if they have high fiber cereals or products that fiber is added to to lower the overall “net effective carbs” or things of that nature (low carb tortillas for example). Count up what you are getting per day for a couple days and then make adjustments. You can always cook your veggies a little more to break down the fiber, or eat lower fiber fruits, or a simpler bread. Worst case scenario, if your iron stays low like that and you can’t bring it up with diet and supplements, you should talk to a doctor. Anemic women are prescribed an iron infusion in situations like these, whether they are athletes or not. Anemia plagues women all the time due to periods and God knows what else. When people have distressed guts that won’t absorb the iron, the only way to get your levels up is to bypass the gut and get the iron into the bloodstream through an IV. But all infusions of any kind are considered a “prohibited method” against WADA/USADA rules unless a doctor feels it is medically necessary and the appropriate TUE documents are filed. As a shameless plug, Picky Bars are a good source of non-heme (vegetarian) iron naturally, due to the nuts and pumpkin seeds. The iron is part of the ingredients naturally, not enriched after the fact with a crushed up vitamin like most bars. Real food nutrients are more bioavailable (more absorbable). Take a look at the nutrition facts. ALF readers, if you have any personal experience with this topic that can help Corrine, please include it below! Thanks in advance! Good luck Corrine.

What should I do? ”Madeline on September 1, 2013 at 3:49 pm said: Hi Lauren and Corrine, I’m a high school senior and I just learned over the summer that I had low ferritin levels. My sophomore year I had an injury and was out for the entire season. For the next track season and both XC and track my junior year, I would feel really tired during races and was not performing to the level that my practice showed that I could. Finally, I decided to get my blood tested to see if I had low ferritin, which I should have done much earlier. My ferritin level was 15 which is really low. I went to my sports medicine doctor and he recommended that I take a ferritin supplement twice a day for a month, and then once a day for a month and then get my blood tested after that. I haven’t gotten my blood tested again yet (although I’m about to) but I am feeling so much better in practice and felt great in my first race. My time compared to last year was about a minute faster and the conditions were worse (horrible heat). Granted it was only a 2 mile race but I can tell that it has helped. My workouts in practice have been better and more consistent too. It did upset my digestive system, however. For the first week or so of taking it, I wouldn’t run anywhere without a bathroom on the route or far away from my house because I would always have to go so badly during my run. It did get better after a while once my body got used to it. I will let you know what my level is once I get my results back! Hopefully this helps!Reply Madeline on September 22, 2013 at 2:37 pm said: Just a quick update to my first comment–the ferritin supplement has helped me a ton!

Thanks for posting that for future readers. Also, that’s interesting about clams. There is conflicting evidence on that subject, but this article makes interesting points worth consideration. Just goes to show that what you read on labels is only part of the story. That being said, my personal experience with clams has netted me very positive results. Red meat is my preference though. Reply Jess on September 12, 2013 at 5:16 am said: I’ve never had low enough iron to need a ferritin test, but I do donate blood a lot and you need a minimum 12.5g/d L hemoglobin level. I struggle to make the cut, since I don’t eat meat, but I found that a breakfast of oatmeal with walnuts and raisins, plus a big glass of OJ (not calcium fortified — apparently calcium inhibits Fe absorption) will put me well over the mark! The Red Cross folks say the raisins and vitamin C are key. I’ve also heard the tannins in tea can inhibit absorption, so limiting that might help. Good luck!Reply Karen on September 17, 2013 at 7:06 am said: If you haven’t continued taking supplementary iron – I would suggest you do so (even though you are seeing limited results). Make sure you take the supplement without things that limit absorption (like tea). I used to take mine with breakfast which included tea. I changed my approach and take as soon as I get up, I run or do my workout and eat over an hour later so the iron has time to absorb. I had extremely low ferritin for several years. I’m pre-menopausal (which may be a factor for me) but also had issues as a late teen-young adult. From the time they started tracking to the time I finally reached the lowest of the “in-range” it took 3-4 years. In the middle of this time frame my primary care required me to go get checked out by a gastro to ensure there was no underlying concern, cancer, celiac, etc. There were no relevant findings – and lately I’ve been a bit tired on runs and light-headed so I may be back down. Ultimately – I know it’s an issue – keeping aware. The gastro did say that a negative finding for celiac didn’t mean that someone could have an intolerance. So you never know on the gluten. Reply Alex on September 21, 2013 at 11:43 am said: I have an interesting story re: ferritin … for anyone whose ferritin keeps dropping and can’t figure it out, might want to check this out. It was 4 years ago, my college junior year. In the outdoor track season, I just kept getting slower and couldnt’ figure out why – and kept feeling more tired. I was recovering from a bout of pneumonia and working a lot, so I figured it was that, so I didn’t go to the doctor till a couple months later – when at that point I could not even walk up stairs I was so tired. They tested my ferritin and it was 1. Yes, ONE. And the hemoglobin was 7. For some reason they didn’t do a blood transfusion and just started me on pills – but couldn’t figure out why it was so low. I ate red meat at least 3x a week, leafy greens, etc all the right dietary stuff. I had a rare and really light period, so that wasn’t it. And I wasn’t doing abnormally high mileage at the time – maybe 60 miles a week. Finally after weeks of specialists they came up with a super interesting (at least to me, since I’m a nurse) diagnosis = foot strike hemoglobinemia. Basically, red blood cells (and therefore, ferritin is effected) are produced in the bones – foot bones included. So doctors discovered this during the civil war from soldiers marching for days on end – endless pounding on their heel bones etc. So apparently my miles and constant walking from the nursing job did the same thing – killed the baby blood cells and ferritin faster than it could be produced. So because of this they changed the dose and type of iron supplements, and throughout my senior cross country season just got less and less tired, and my season got better and better. So if anyone has mystery iron/ferritin loss, maybe just mention this to the doctor – footstrike (march) hemoglobinemia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_hemolytic_anemia Reply Andy on September 30, 2013 at 10:52 pm said: Hi, of course being a woman a source of iron loss could be the monthly issue. That can be controlled with certain birth control pills- some you can take without a break, if you are having issues with that. The best absorption of an iron supplement happens with vitamin-c containing juice right in the morning on an empty stomach, but that may irritate your tummy. At least make sure not to take iron with dairy products like milk (thus, Calcium containing) lowering the iron absorption. Usually the bloodtest for celiac disease is quite specific/ sensitive and especially if the intestinal biopsy comes out clear, it really is nearly excluded you suffer from that. Of course it is important to have a normal diet with gluten when taking the test or having the colonoscopy. It seems that the self-diagnosed ´gluten intolerance´is quite common among runners who oftentimes needlessly restrict their diets to an unhealthy extent.

Reply Emily on June 9, 2014 at 8:29 am said: I know this is an old thread. But I’m curious if any of the advice has helped Connie with her Iron levels. I had a long history of problems with my iron and so does my sister, mother and grandmother. I was taking suppliements and being careful about what I was pairing with my meals to ensure maximum absorption without good results. Turns out, I have a genetic problem where certain B vitamins are not easily processed. And so, my cells cannot easily absorb iron. I was taking prescription Iron supplements, but since my cells couldn’t easily absorb the iron it didn’t matter how much iron I injested. My body simply couldn’t use it. Evidently, knowledge about this specific defect is pretty recent. It’s MTHFR Defect – there is a bunch of information online if you put this in your web search. It’s a very simple test, just a few blood samples. And my insurance covered most of it. I think I paid out something like $50, including the copay. I don’t know if Connie is having the same problem as I was, and I’m certainly not assuming that everyone has the same problem as I do. But if she is not having successful results increasing her iron levels, then she might want to have this conversation with her doctor. A discussion with her parents and grandparents may be helpful as well. Good luck.

I understand that this is a very old post put it applies well to my situation. I’m a high school runner with low iron. As well, I’ve struggled with amenhorea for 3.5 years. I’m now experiencing pain in my foot that my doctor believes might be a fracture. Of course if it is a fracture, I will not be competing this outdoor season. I’m looking for advice when it comes to competing if my foot is not fractured. Do you think it would be valuable to not run this season to restore my cycle and iron? I will be running next year at a large, competitive university. Any advice you have would be so greatly appreciated. By the way, loving the ROO podcasts! !Reply Inglis on September 25, 2016 at 1:02 pm said: We’ll at once take hold of the really simply syndication while i are not able to to find your own e-mail registration backlink or maybe e-newsletter assistance.

Reply Abigail on April 10, 2017 at 10:46 pm said: I have a 16 year old son (I know-rare! )/ elite level XC/Track athlete who was diagnosed with anemia last October with ferritin at 11. He’s been taking liquid ferritin with oj or beet juice twice a day and increased meat consumption etc. since diagnosis. He felt and performed much better even after a month, and his performance and training has continued to really improve since. But we just got his levels retested this week and they are still only at a 28 when we were hoping for much higher. The only thing I can think of is that he has oatmeal not long after the am dose but it never has milk (calcium). Any insight? Reply Leave a Reply\n",

            "Text: \"Causes of Extreme Fatigue The Most Common Reasons for Excessive Fatigue Discovering the causes of extreme fatigue can be difficult if you don't know the distinctions between fatigue and sleepiness. Some disorders cause fatigue, others sleepiness, and some disorders cause a mix of these two. The question is: \"\"Are you tired, sleepy, or fatigue? \"\"In this page you will learn: What is extreme fatigue, compared to sleepiness and tiredness,What causes extreme fatigue, including most common disorders and medication,Useful questionnaire to test your excessive fatigue,How to stop fatigue in a sleep apnea patient. What is Severe Fatigue? Feelings of excessive fatigue, tiredness and sleepiness have different descriptions. Explaining correctly how do you feel to your doctor may be critical to find the real causes of extreme fatigue. Let's learn how can we make the difference between extreme fatigue and daytime sleepiness: Definition of Extreme Fatigue According to Sleep Disorders and Sleep Promotion in Nursing Practice, fatigue means an overwhelming sense of tiredness, lack of energy, and a feeling of weakness linked with physical or psychological problems. In simple words, fatigue is an unpleasant feeling that describes sensations of muscle weakness and low energy, but without having sleepiness. Fatigue is something that you feel when:you finish the physical activity or exercise,you are depressed,you are bored, and have no inspiration for doing something. People with fatigue usually want to rest, sitting down on a chair, or laying down on the bad, but without wanting to sleep. Definition of Daytime Sleepiness Sleepiness, is the tendency to fall asleep during the day. A person with excessive daytime sleepiness has the desire to fall asleep or has unintended episodes of falling asleep in during daytime. Compared to fatigue, sleepiness is in general a pleasant feeling of drowsiness. It makes you lie down, close your eyes, and fall asleep. This sensation is occurs in general before falling asleep. Comparison: Excessive Fatigue vs Excessive Sleepiness Differences Between Fatigue and Sleepiness Fatigue Sleepiness- is something that you feel in your body,- is something that comes from your mind,- your muscles might be sensitive or achy. The general sensation is unpleasant,- it's difficult to stay awake and to keep your eyes open. The eyelids become heavy. Normally, the sensation is pleasant.- you don't have the energy to work, or to do something,- your mind can't focus, and is seeking a way to fall asleep,- if you force yourself to continue the work while tired, you may feel frustration and even pain in your body.- Forcing yourself to stay awake can generate frustration, anxiety and even pain. Understanding the differences between sleepiness is important for finding an effective treatment, especially in insomnia. For example, many patients with insomnia try to fall asleep when they feel tired but not sleepy. Moreover, they take sleeping pills to which do not cure their problem, but it may aggravate it. Causes of Extreme Fatigue Disorders That Causes Excessive Fatigue1. Insomnia Insomnia is one of the most common causes of extreme fatigue. It is a syndrome where the complaints are:difficulty falling asleep,trying to stay asleep, and waking up often,having unrefreshing sleep,irritability,frustration,daytime fatigue with lack of energy,memory problems,problems at work or in the family. Due to lack of refreshing sleep, insomnia will also cause excessive daytime sleepiness, which can affect important activities such as driving or working. For more info on insomnia, see Insomnia Disorder.2. Jet Lag Jet Lag is another cause of extreme fatigue. It appears when you force your body to change his body clock faster than normal. This can happen in air travel across several times zones. Symptoms of Jet Lag are:extreme fatigue during the day,disturbed sleep,insomnia - can't fall asleep,poor concentration.3. Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) causes extreme fatigue mainly in the morning, because the person with DSPS has sleep onset and waking times delayed by couple of hours compared to normal people. This person feels sleepy and goes to bed very late, at about 2 - 6 am, and wakes up at 10 am to 1 pm. This syndrome is most common in adolescents and young adults, but can occur in any age.4. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) causes extreme fatigue and sleepiness during the day, by breathing less during sleep. If your breathing less, the oxygen level drops and carbon dioxide levels build up, causing morning headaches, nausea, fatigue and sleepiness in daytime.5. Type 2 Respiratory Failure Type 2 Respiratory Failure is responsible for causing extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, loss of energy, sleepiness, insomnia, nightmares, and headaches in the morning. Type 2 Respiratory Failure is a condition where your oxygen levels are low and carbon dioxide levels are high. In healthy people, the O2 levels are high and CO2 levels are low.6. Hormonal Imbalance Hormonal Imbalance is one of the common causes of extreme fatigue: Hormonal Imbalances that causes Fatiguediabetes mellitus - which is also found in many patients with obstructive sleep apnea.thyroid disease - hypothyroidism is associated with fatigue.menopause - daytime fatigue and sleep disturbances are the most common symptoms during menopause.postmenopausal women - are at increased risk for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea, which can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and extreme fatigue.pregnancy - many women experience fatigue and daytime sleepiness during first trimester and third trimester from conception, due to the difficulty of falling asleep. In the second trimester of pregnancy, many women experience a great improvement in their sleep quality and daytime energy levels.after pregnancy - many women feel more fatigue due to low level of iron. Eating well and taking a nap during the day when the baby is napping help to recover the energy levels.7. Heart failure Hear failure often causes feelings of daytime fatigue and sleepiness. During sleep, patients with heart failure can experience shortness of breath or longer pauses in breathing because of poor circulation to the brain. Sleep Apnea is common in patients with heart failure and also affects the quality of sleep. For more info on diabetes in patients with sleep apnea, see Sleep Apnea and Diabetes.8. Cancer Cancer has many factors that causes excessive fatigue, such as:weight loss,breakdown of the tissues with release of energy,hormonal imbalances,depression and anxiety, which by themselves can cause fatigue,sleep disruption can also lead to sleepiness and fatigue,cancer treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy can also cause extreme fatigue.9. Depression Depression can cause insomnia, restless sleep and fatigue. In addition, OSA and depression are common causes of extreme fatigue in patients with severe sleep apnea. These 2 disorders share common symptoms such as: fatigue, sleepiness, restless sleep and awakenings, irritability and low sexual drive. If you snore during sleep and you are depressed and excessive fatigue during the day, you should suspect obstructive sleep apnea. Treating OSA will help tremendously in alleviating depression. For more info on depression in sleep apnea patients, see Sleep Apnea and Depression.11. Seasonal Affective Disorder Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is present during winter, when it's getting dark sooner than in the summer. The are a multitude of SAD symptoms, such as:sleep problems,depression, anxiety, irritability, unable to cope with work duties,excessive fatigue and low energy levels, lethargy feelings,hormonal problems, including irregular menstrual periods,reduced libido,concentration and memory problems,increased sensibility to viral infections. These symptoms occurs only in winter, and excessive fatigue and sleeping problems last a shorter time than depression which last until February.12. Stroke Stroke leads to sleep problems and fatigue symptoms during the day. Fatigue is found in 3 to 4 in 10 patients with stroke, but excessive daytime sleepiness is also common in about 2 to 4 patients. Furthermore, people who have a stroke may develop shortness of breath during sleep, or pauses in breathing, which can lead to extreme fatigue and sleepiness during the day. However, sleep disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea, can also cause stroke.13. Parkinson Parkinson causes sleep disturbances, which can lead to fatigue and sleepiness during the day. Many medications used to treat Parkinson can worsen these sleep disturbances. If the patient snores or have sleep apnea, this can increase the levels of fatigue.14. Brain surgery Brain surgery can lead to fatigue if the brain tissue was damaged. However, fatigue is also common in any other major surgery, and it may take months to recover your energy levels. Some medications used after surgery can also increase the fatigue and sleepiness levels.15. Post Polio Syndrome Post Polio Syndrome causes extreme fatigue by increasing the weakness of the muscles that control breathing. This can affect the normal breathing during sleep, lowering the level of O2 and increasing CO2 levels. Feelings of morning headaches, daytime fatigue and low appetite are common in patients with post-polio syndrome. Furthermore, sleeping problems can increase the weakness of the muscles.16. Sleep disorders Sleep disorders are not only common causes of extreme fatigue, but also for excessive daytime sleepiness. Patients with sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic leg movement disorder or narcolepsy may describe extreme fatigue as:feeling tiredfatiguedlow energysleepinesslazydrowsysleepyexcessive somnolence A patient with extreme fatigue associated with a sleep disorder often takes naps, but are usually non-refreshing. In fact, no amount of sleep relieves these symptoms of extreme fatigue. Mild sleep apnea can also cause fatigue and sleepiness. Patients with mild OSA can be helped with alternative treatments, such as positional therapy. However, the most effective treatments are weight loss (in overweight patients) and CPAP. To learn how to treat sleep apnea, see Sleep Apnea Treatment. Other Causes of Extreme Fatigue - Medications Medications for depression like antidepressants, can cause sleepiness and fatigue. A study evaluated the side effects of antidepressants and found that 30% of almost 100 patients had symptoms of permanent fatigue and sleepiness. Read the study here. Drugs that reduce the high blood pressure (antihypertensives), especially alpha 2 receptor agonists, beta-blockers and alpha 1 receptor antagonists are also common causes of extreme fatigue. Drugs that treat abnormal heart rhythm (antiarrhythmic medications) also may cause sedation. Questionnaire for Diagnosing Fatigue Severity The Fatigue Severity Scale This self-rated test can help you assess the severity of your fatigue symptoms in different aspects of your life. You have to rate each item from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). The higher the score, the greater the fatigue. It was established that a score of 3 is the limit between normal and abnormal fatigue levels. The Fatigue Severity Scale Motivation is lower when I'm feeling fatigued. Exercises produces my fatigue. I am easily fatigued. Fatigue interferes with my physical abilities. Fatigue causes frequent problems for me. My fatigue prevents sustained physical functioning. Fatigue interferes with carrying out certain duties and responsibilities. Being fatigued is among my three most disabling symptoms. My fatigue interferes with my work, family, or social life. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)ESS is used to diagnose the severity of daytime sleepiness, or the tendency to fall asleep during the day. If you have a score of 10 or above, then you have an abnormal level of daytime sleepiness. Furthermore, if the test shows 10 or more, you should avoid driving. Daytime sleepiness peaks during the mid-afternoon hours, and traffic accidents are usually common during these times. For more info on sleepiness questionnaire, see Epworth sleepiness scale. Summary on Causes of Extreme Fatigue: Sleepiness is a normal sensation when you have the tendency to fall asleep. However, people with excessive sleepiness have the tendency to fall asleep at inappropriate times and circumstances (at work, while driving, etc). Sleepiness is mainly caused by the lack of sleep, or poor quality of sleep. Fatigue is different from sleepiness, and is associated with feelings of tiredness, exhaustion, weariness, and lack of energy. Some people with extreme fatigue think they are sleepy, although they don't have the need to sleep. Causes of extreme fatigue include a wide variety of medical, psychiatric and neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disorders. That's why is important to visit your doctor if you feel extreme fatigue every day for more than 3 weeks. There are important tests to reveal the underlying causes of extreme fatigue, including nocturnal polysomnography followed by a Multiple Sleep Latency Test ( MSLT ). These test are very important to identify exactly what are your causes of extreme fatigue and how severe they are. After you have all the information from these tests, your doctor will know what is the most effective treatment.

            "Text: Home Articles Body & Health Conditions Autoimmune diseases Fibromyalgia and Arthritis - What is the Difference?3Commentsby Jennifer Bunn — 2010-09-05 in Autoimmune diseases It can be very difficult to differentiate between fibromyalgia and arthritis. The two conditions have much in common in terms of pain. Even doctors may have difficulty telling the difference between the two. What is fibromyalgia? There are, however, some major differences between these two painful and debilitating conditions. It is helpful to have a good understanding of both conditions before the differences between the conditions can be fully understood. Fibromyalgia is a condition in which the main symptom is pain. Pain can be felt anywhere on the body and is typically experienced in more than one area, although there may be one area that is most painful. Most people with fibromyalgia also complain of fatigue. This fatigue is not the normal fatigue that many people experience- the fatigue of fibromyalgia is all-consuming and may make it difficult for a person to go about their daily routine. There are many other symptoms that a person with fibromyalgia may suffer from, such as headaches, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, numbness and tingling in the extremities, skin problems, dry eyes, mouth and throat, cognitive dysfunction and TMJ pain. Many people with fibromyalgia also suffer from depression and anxiety due to the disabling symptoms they often experience. There are no tests that can definitively diagnose fibromyalgia. People with fibromyalgia are often subjected to a battery of tests when their physician tries to discover the source of their pain and fatigue. These tests are often done to rule out other conditions that share common symptoms with fibromyalgia. However, these tests are usually negative and fibromyalgia is diagnosed when another cause for symptoms is ruled out. Fibromyalgia may be confused with thyroid or blood disorders, cancer, lupus, ankylosing spondylitis and, of course, arthritis. The American College of Rheumatology has set forth criteria for the diagnosis of fibromyalgia which includes pain/tenderness lasting longer than 3 month consistently, pain on both sides of the body and both above and below the waist and the presence of 11 out of 18 identified “tender points”, or areas that are tender when a prescribed amount of pressure is applied. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is made only if there is no other identified or recognized cause for pain. This is why tests are required: to rule out other conditions, not to rule in fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia symptoms may wax and wane. In other words, symptoms may come and go. Symptoms may even disappear for weeks and months, providing a “remission” from the pain and fatigue that accompany fibromyalgia. When symptoms are present, they are treated with a variety of lifestyle modifications and medications that target pain and fatigue. Related symptoms, such as gastrointestinal complaints, may be treated based on symptoms. Fibromyalgia does not cause damage to body tissues and is not fatal. People with fibromyalgia live as long as people without the debilitating disorder. What is arthritis? People are more familiar with arthritis, as it is also a common condition. Arthritis is actually an umbrella term for more than 100 conditions. When people talk about arthritis, they are often referring to one of two types of arthritis, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is the more serious form of the two. In rheumatoid arthritis, swelling and pain of the joints is the most common symptom. Sufferers may also experience fatigue, weight loss, fever and loss of appetite. People with rheumatoid arthritis often feel stiff and sore for a period of time upon awakening. Sometimes other organs are involved, such as the eyes, heart and skin. Some people are affected mildly, while others experience a severe form of the disease. The disease is more common in women. Rheumatoid arthritis often affects the small joints of the fingers and toes, as well as the knees and wrists. However, any joint can be affected. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the lining of the joints, eventually destroying bone and cartilage. Blood tests may often reveal elevated inflammatory markers in the blood. These inflammatory markers can be used to gauge response to treatment. Treatment is aimed at halting the progression of the disease and minimizing joint destruction. Steroids and antiinflammatories are often used for this purpose. Surgery is sometimes needed to replace joints that have been severely affected by rheumatoid arthritis. Osteoarthritis (also known as degenerative joint disease) is one of the oldest recognized diseases in humans. Osteoarthritis causes joint tissue to break down, resulting in joint pain and stiffness. It commonly affects knees, spine, hips and feet. Many older people suffer from this form of arthritis. This type of arthritis is progressive and may lead to crippling symptoms if left untreated. READ Broccoli And Protection From Arthritis What are the main differences between fibromyalgia and arthritis? Fibromyalgia does not result in the destruction of joints Fibromyalgia is not associated with inflammation Fibromyalgia never requires surgery as a form of treatment Medications to treat fibromyalgia and arthritis are often different There are no blood tests for fibromyalgia X-rays and other imaging tests will be normal in fibromyalgia (unless the person has another health problem)Overwhelming fatigue is common in fibromyalgia Pain in fibromyalgia is related to the muscles, whereas pain in arthritis is related to the joints Other organs, such as the heart, are not affected by inflammation in fibromyalgia Depression occurs more commonly in fibromyalgia There is no obvious joint swelling in fibromyalgia, although some people with fibromyalgia experience tissue swelling (i.e. hands and feet)Paresthesias (tingling, numbness and other abnormal sensations) occur commonly in fibromyalgia Headaches are more common in fibromyalgia Fibromyalgia can be more difficult to diagnose than arthritis Hypothyroidism and hypoglycemia have been implicated in fibromyalgia, but not in arthritis Although fibromyalgia and arthritis share some common symptoms, such as pain, they are more different than they are similar. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is often made after arthritis has been ruled out as a potential cause for pain. While both conditions can be debilitating, arthritis leaves identifiable damage to joints in its wake, while fibromyalgia does not result in joint damage. Understanding the two conditions makes it easier to see the differences between the two conditions. Sources & Links\n",

            "Text: Abdullah Al Amin, works at University of Akron Answered Jan 25, 2017There are two different types of responses for material under cyclic loading.- One type of material has an asymptotic response to the S-N curve, meaning their cycle number increases as loading is reduces until the load reduces to such a level where the material has infinite life. Namely, the material doesn't fail if the load is below this limit. This limit is the fatigue limit.- The other type of material on the contrary continues to show increasing cycle number with decreasing load. So it is very hard for these types of material to define a minimal load for which they will have infinite life. These types of material need to have a defined cycle number, in most cases which is 10e7 cycles. This is called the endurance limit. The very basic difference between fatigue and endurance limit is that the endurance limit has cycle number mentioned with it. We can look at it from the literal meaning of those words. Fatigue limit is that load limit below which material gains infinite life. Endurance limit is that load at which the material sustained defined number of cycles (Usually 10e7 cycles)The strengths are the numerical values of stress at that specific fatigue/endurance limit.8.4k Views · View Upvoters Related Questions More Answers Below What is the difference between fatigue life and fatigue strength?

            "Text: \"A blog to help you optimize your full-body and life performance Go back Got fatigue? Increase your ferritin!By Perrin Braun Jul 31, 2013Ferritin levels are important for everyone—whether you’re male or female, an avid exerciser or a couch potato. If your ferritin levels are too low, you may feel fatigued and run down, which can be a problem for anyone, no matter their level of physical activity. To find out exactly what your ferritin levels are, sign up for an Inside Tracker plan. If your levels are out-of-range, Inside Tracker will give you suggestions for diet, exercise, supplement and lifestyle changes to help you optimize them. What is ferritin, and why is it important? Ferritin is a type of protein that binds to iron. In fact, most of the iron that is stored in the body is bound to ferritin, which makes it a good marker for how much iron you have. Iron is an essential mineral that is a part of the protein hemoglobin, which is found in all the body’s red blood cells. Hemoglobin works to supply the muscles and other organs with enough oxygen, as well as to help the body to convert carbohydrates and fat into energy. Maintaining optimal levels of iron is important for athletes and non-athletes alike because iron plays the following important roles in the body: Produces red blood cells and hemoglobin Synthesizes protein Maintains the health of hair and skin Fights infection and preserves the body’s immune system Helps to create energy Why do low ferritin levels make you tired? If you’re deficient in iron, you probably have lower levels of red blood cells and hemoglobin. As a result, your blood can carry less oxygen to your muscles and brain, and this can negatively impact performance and overall wellbeing. Since red blood cells play a critical role in transporting oxygen to cells, tissues, and organs throughout your body, a lack of oxygen can make you feel lethargic and weak. Low levels of iron in the blood can decrease your body’s ability to use energy efficiently during exercise or normal physical activities. Symptoms of iron deficiency can include frequent injury, a weakened immune system, chronic fatigue, irritability, and a high exercise heart rate. If you’re an athlete who wants to keep your body energized throughout an athletic event, you need to maintain your iron levels so that you don’t become fatigued too quickly! Even if you’re not an athlete, people with ferritin deficiency may feel tired and weak, which can result in decreased levels of concentration. How much iron do you need? Inside Tracker will calculate the amount of iron you need based on your age, gender, ethnicity, and athletic activity. View the live demo!Who is at risk for iron deficiency? Three groups of people face increased risk of iron deficiency: athletes, women below the age of 50, and vegetarians. Athletes tend to deplete iron at faster rates than non-athletes, which can explain why nearly twenty percent of all recreational athletes are anemic (which means they have low ferritin and low hemoglobin) and a third are iron deficient (which means they have low ferritin). Athletes: Your body loses iron during heavy training periods through sweating, running, and the gastrointestinal bleeding that can sometimes follow intense workouts. So, it’s very important to watch your iron intake to avoid plateauing during an athletic event. Athletes with low levels of iron should raise their blood iron level, which consequently increases the amount of oxygen their lungs can absorb (known as their VO2max) and their anaerobic capacity. Pre-menopausal women are at an increased risk for depleted iron levels because of the hemoglobin that is lost in blood during menstruation. In particular, female athletes are three times more likely to be anemic than non-athletic women. Finally, vegetarians are also at risk of iron-deficiency because the iron in plant-based foods (non-heme iron) is harder for the body to absorb than the iron in animal products (heme iron). How can you increase your levels of iron? There are two types of dietary iron: heme and non-heme. Meat, especially red meat, is the best source of heme iron. When we eat meat, we consume the blood proteins and the hemoglobin that are contained in the body of the animal. In contrast, non-heme iron comes primarily from plants. Non-heme iron actually comprises the majority of the iron that we consume in our diets. Rice, wheat, oats, nuts, fruits, vegetables, beans, and fortified processed foods are typical sources of non-heme iron. Heme iron is typically absorbed at a higher rate than non-heme iron, which means that the body more easily absorbs iron from animal products than iron derived from plant foods. If you’re a vegetarian, keep in mind that the absorption rate of the heme iron from animal-based sources ranges from 15-35 percent, compared to 2-20 percent absorption of non-heme iron. Therefore, vegetarians may need to consume twice as much dietary iron as meat-eaters to absorb an adequate amount of iron each day. There are many good sources of non-heme iron. Dark leafy greens and dried beans are among the best vegetarian sources of iron. Many breakfast cereals and bread products are fortified with iron, so make sure you’re eating plenty of those, especially whole-grain foods! Inside Tracker has a vegetarian option and will recommend a variety of veggie foods that can fulfill your iron needs. In addition, several types of foods can reduce the amount of non-heme iron that the body absorbs. For example, the tannins in coffee and tea, dairy products, fiber, eggs, and some types of chocolate can inhibit the absorption of non-heme iron. The good news is that vitamin C helps to markedly increase the absorption of non-heme iron. For instance, drinking a glass of orange juice with your dinner can increase non-heme iron absorption up to six-fold!You can also consider taking an iron supplement, but if you do, be sure to take it with a food or beverage that is high in vitamin C (such as orange juice!) to increase absorption. However, it’s important to remember that the amount of iron supplement that is needed varies depending on your blood analysis results, plus your age, gender, ethnicity, and athletic activity. Regardless of whether or not you eat meat or take a supplement, it’s important to know your ferritin status so that you have enough energy to get through the day.

I've been getting it for years.hivalb • 1 year ago Low ferritin is also implicated in Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS). I saw a RLS specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital and he said a ferritin level of <50 ng is considered abnormal for RLS patients. Meanwhile your other blood work will look fine. If you have RLS, talk to your doctor about getting your ferritin checked. Lorena • 2 years ago My ferritin level is 1100 how can I make itl low, plz help me Eugene • 2 years ago Donate blood. Best way. Choose the \"\"double red\"\" donation where they take twice as much red blood cells, then return your plasma. You can get a doctor's prescription to donate more often than they would typically let you. Monitor your iron/ferritin levels as you go, because you don't want it to get too low either. Nicole • 2 years ago In the past three years I've noticed extreme hair shedding, difficulty getting a full breath in and extreme fatigue. I would was able to fall asleep out of no where in the middle of the day. My iron was tested as normal, I knew something was not right with my body regardless of what all the specialist and ny PCP said, \"\"I'm fine, everything looks normal\"\". Finally after many hours spent doing my own research I told them to check my ferritin levels. Sure enough mine was low. It was still in a \"\"normal\"\" range as the lab sheet suggested but your ferritin levels need to be atleast a 70^ for hairloss to stop. I had my ferrtin tested 2/2015 and have added an iron supplement along with my prenatals, biotin and l-lysine and vitamin C and as of today 4/29 my ferritin went from 30 to 48! I feel so much better already and I can feel all the new hair growth on my sclap and my hair is not shedding 200+ hairs a day! Do your own research and if something doesn't work, don't get discouraged and keep doing going on your own search.

            "Text: Share August 30, 2013Q: Can’t Boost My Iron! What should I do? Hi Lauren,As an athlete I’ve struggled to manage my ferritin and it has begun to get frustrating. There was a while I was getting a blood panel done at least every 6months, mostly to track our athlete specific trends for our team physiologist. Two years ago now my ferritin took a nose dive from 72 down to 30 and has since then continued to slowly dwindle. Currently at a pale 19. The first dive happened after I moved away from home (where I ate game meat regularly) to living in the Olympic training center, so I could see the dietary link to the decline. However since then I have been living outside a cafeteria setting, taking periodized iron supplements ( recently trying the liquid kind) but my stores just keep sliding. I’m wondering if you have found any strong link with gluten? My diet is primarily based on vegetables (leafy greens, etc), hearty grains, and lean red meat. With a bunch of endurance athletes in the house we eat pretty well but we do eat a bit of (very gluten-y) bread…. I guess I’m grasping for straws… help? Corrine A: Corrine,Mmmmmm….oysters….in a can. A couple iron rich foods you could try to get an extra boost are clams, muscles, and oysters. They are much higher than beef! 20 small clams has 295% DV of iron compared to 35% DV in a 6oz steak! You could either eat them for dinner, or have a tin of smoked clams with crackers for a snack or at lunch. They are magic. The tins are cheap and portable and loaded with iron. Some people think they are disgusting, but I like ’em, kind of. Well I like the results When my iron is low I’m desperate, and I’ll eat anything besides liver and onions. That shit is nasty. What about wheat? There are links between wheat and iron for some people, but from what I understand it’s only an issue when pairing the iron with wheat at a given meal. If you have a turkey sandwich for lunch and then a steak and potatoes for dinner, that shouldn’t matter. If you have celiac disease, then it’s a different story. Gluten could definitely be the cause of your declining iron in that case, and it would also be causing a decline in lots of other vitamin and mineral stores as well. I’d get a blood test for celiac or gluten intolerance before sacrificing your diet unnecessarily. Bread is just too damn good. But yeah, don’t eat it with your iron if you’re having trouble keeping the iron up. Too much fiber can interfere with iron absorption too. This is the secret culprit for most athletes who are eating iron but still experiencing low blood levels. A lot of athletes inadvertently make it harder and harder to absorb iron because they are trying so hard to get raw veggies and whole grains in, but fiber gets things moving quickly through the system, and you can have too much of a good thing. Less time in the intestines means less time for vitamins and minerals to absorb. If you have frequent loose stools, this probably applies to you. The daily recommendation for fiber is 25-35 g per day. Athletes trying to be really healthy often eat double that, especially if they have high fiber cereals or products that fiber is added to to lower the overall “net effective carbs” or things of that nature (low carb tortillas for example). Count up what you are getting per day for a couple days and then make adjustments. You can always cook your veggies a little more to break down the fiber, or eat lower fiber fruits, or a simpler bread. Worst case scenario, if your iron stays low like that and you can’t bring it up with diet and supplements, you should talk to a doctor. Anemic women are prescribed an iron infusion in situations like these, whether they are athletes or not. Anemia plagues women all the time due to periods and God knows what else. When people have distressed guts that won’t absorb the iron, the only way to get your levels up is to bypass the gut and get the iron into the bloodstream through an IV. But all infusions of any kind are considered a “prohibited method” against WADA/USADA rules unless a doctor feels it is medically necessary and the appropriate TUE documents are filed. As a shameless plug, Picky Bars are a good source of non-heme (vegetarian) iron naturally, due to the nuts and pumpkin seeds. The iron is part of the ingredients naturally, not enriched after the fact with a crushed up vitamin like most bars. Real food nutrients are more bioavailable (more absorbable). Take a look at the nutrition facts. ALF readers, if you have any personal experience with this topic that can help Corrine, please include it below! Thanks in advance! Good luck Corrine.

What should I do? ”Madeline on September 1, 2013 at 3:49 pm said: Hi Lauren and Corrine, I’m a high school senior and I just learned over the summer that I had low ferritin levels. My sophomore year I had an injury and was out for the entire season. For the next track season and both XC and track my junior year, I would feel really tired during races and was not performing to the level that my practice showed that I could. Finally, I decided to get my blood tested to see if I had low ferritin, which I should have done much earlier. My ferritin level was 15 which is really low. I went to my sports medicine doctor and he recommended that I take a ferritin supplement twice a day for a month, and then once a day for a month and then get my blood tested after that. I haven’t gotten my blood tested again yet (although I’m about to) but I am feeling so much better in practice and felt great in my first race. My time compared to last year was about a minute faster and the conditions were worse (horrible heat). Granted it was only a 2 mile race but I can tell that it has helped. My workouts in practice have been better and more consistent too. It did upset my digestive system, however. For the first week or so of taking it, I wouldn’t run anywhere without a bathroom on the route or far away from my house because I would always have to go so badly during my run. It did get better after a while once my body got used to it. I will let you know what my level is once I get my results back! Hopefully this helps!Reply Madeline on September 22, 2013 at 2:37 pm said: Just a quick update to my first comment–the ferritin supplement has helped me a ton! That combined with my summer training has made such a difference that I am running around a minute faster than I was last year, if not more than a minute!Reply Lisa on September 4, 2014 at 1:12 pm said: Hi,My ferritin levels are low as well.

Thanks for posting that for future readers. Also, that’s interesting about clams. There is conflicting evidence on that subject, but this article makes interesting points worth consideration. Just goes to show that what you read on labels is only part of the story. That being said, my personal experience with clams has netted me very positive results. Red meat is my preference though. Reply Jess on September 12, 2013 at 5:16 am said: I’ve never had low enough iron to need a ferritin test, but I do donate blood a lot and you need a minimum 12.5g/d L hemoglobin level. I struggle to make the cut, since I don’t eat meat, but I found that a breakfast of oatmeal with walnuts and raisins, plus a big glass of OJ (not calcium fortified — apparently calcium inhibits Fe absorption) will put me well over the mark! The Red Cross folks say the raisins and vitamin C are key. I’ve also heard the tannins in tea can inhibit absorption, so limiting that might help. Good luck!Reply Karen on September 17, 2013 at 7:06 am said: If you haven’t continued taking supplementary iron – I would suggest you do so (even though you are seeing limited results). Make sure you take the supplement without things that limit absorption (like tea). I used to take mine with breakfast which included tea. I changed my approach and take as soon as I get up, I run or do my workout and eat over an hour later so the iron has time to absorb. I had extremely low ferritin for several years. I’m pre-menopausal (which may be a factor for me) but also had issues as a late teen-young adult. From the time they started tracking to the time I finally reached the lowest of the “in-range” it took 3-4 years. In the middle of this time frame my primary care required me to go get checked out by a gastro to ensure there was no underlying concern, cancer, celiac, etc. There were no relevant findings – and lately I’ve been a bit tired on runs and light-headed so I may be back down. Ultimately – I know it’s an issue – keeping aware. The gastro did say that a negative finding for celiac didn’t mean that someone could have an intolerance. So you never know on the gluten. Reply Alex on September 21, 2013 at 11:43 am said: I have an interesting story re: ferritin … for anyone whose ferritin keeps dropping and can’t figure it out, might want to check this out. It was 4 years ago, my college junior year. In the outdoor track season, I just kept getting slower and couldnt’ figure out why – and kept feeling more tired. I was recovering from a bout of pneumonia and working a lot, so I figured it was that, so I didn’t go to the doctor till a couple months later – when at that point I could not even walk up stairs I was so tired. They tested my ferritin and it was 1. Yes, ONE. And the hemoglobin was 7. For some reason they didn’t do a blood transfusion and just started me on pills – but couldn’t figure out why it was so low. I ate red meat at least 3x a week, leafy greens, etc all the right dietary stuff. I had a rare and really light period, so that wasn’t it. And I wasn’t doing abnormally high mileage at the time – maybe 60 miles a week. Finally after weeks of specialists they came up with a super interesting (at least to me, since I’m a nurse) diagnosis = foot strike hemoglobinemia. Basically, red blood cells (and therefore, ferritin is effected) are produced in the bones – foot bones included. So doctors discovered this during the civil war from soldiers marching for days on end – endless pounding on their heel bones etc. So apparently my miles and constant walking from the nursing job did the same thing – killed the baby blood cells and ferritin faster than it could be produced. So because of this they changed the dose and type of iron supplements, and throughout my senior cross country season just got less and less tired, and my season got better and better. So if anyone has mystery iron/ferritin loss, maybe just mention this to the doctor – footstrike (march) hemoglobinemia. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_hemolytic_anemia Reply Andy on September 30, 2013 at 10:52 pm said: Hi, of course being a woman a source of iron loss could be the monthly issue. That can be controlled with certain birth control pills- some you can take without a break, if you are having issues with that. The best absorption of an iron supplement happens with vitamin-c containing juice right in the morning on an empty stomach, but that may irritate your tummy. At least make sure not to take iron with dairy products like milk (thus, Calcium containing) lowering the iron absorption. Usually the bloodtest for celiac disease is quite specific/ sensitive and especially if the intestinal biopsy comes out clear, it really is nearly excluded you suffer from that. Of course it is important to have a normal diet with gluten when taking the test or having the colonoscopy. It seems that the self-diagnosed ´gluten intolerance´is quite common among runners who oftentimes needlessly restrict their diets to an unhealthy extent.

Reply Emily on June 9, 2014 at 8:29 am said: I know this is an old thread. But I’m curious if any of the advice has helped Connie with her Iron levels. I had a long history of problems with my iron and so does my sister, mother and grandmother. I was taking suppliements and being careful about what I was pairing with my meals to ensure maximum absorption without good results. Turns out, I have a genetic problem where certain B vitamins are not easily processed. And so, my cells cannot easily absorb iron. I was taking prescription Iron supplements, but since my cells couldn’t easily absorb the iron it didn’t matter how much iron I injested. My body simply couldn’t use it. Evidently, knowledge about this specific defect is pretty recent. It’s MTHFR Defect – there is a bunch of information online if you put this in your web search. It’s a very simple test, just a few blood samples. And my insurance covered most of it. I think I paid out something like $50, including the copay. I don’t know if Connie is having the same problem as I was, and I’m certainly not assuming that everyone has the same problem as I do. But if she is not having successful results increasing her iron levels, then she might want to have this conversation with her doctor. A discussion with her parents and grandparents may be helpful as well. Good luck.

            "Text: The Iron Needs of Athletes: Who Needs More, and How to Get it Through Your Diet Iron is essential for life – every cell in your body needs iron to function. Understandably, athletes are often concerned about iron, because iron is part of hemoglobin in blood and myoglobin in muscles, helping deliver oxygen to cells. Low hemoglobin can result in fatigue and decreased aerobic capacity, leading some athletes to assume that extra iron will enhance performance. Indeed, some endurance athletes take iron supplements regardless of their iron status, even though excess iron might compromise their health. On the other hand, truly iron deficient athletes might not be aware of their status, and changes in their diet or iron supplements might reduce fatigue or improve performance. But dietary changes aren’t straightforward because iron absorption is a complicated phenomenon. Read on to find outif you might be at risk for iron deficiencyhow much iron you need and the best dietary strategies to increase your iron intakepotential pitfalls to avoid when increasing dietary iron intake Which Athletes Are at Greatest Risk for Iron Deficiency? Endurance athletes, particularly females and adolescents, are at risk for reduced iron stores and anemia (reduced blood cell mass or hemoglobin concentration). Intense training increases iron demands, and exercise can deplete iron stores through increased red blood cell production, tissue inflammation, sweating, and destruction of red blood cells with impact (foot strike). Adolescents are growing rapidly and iron demands are high, and women lose iron through menstruation. Studies show that adolescents and women don’t consume enough iron in their diet, and experts believe that this inadequate intake is a major contributor to iron deficiency. How Do I Know if I’m Deficient in Iron? Athletes should consult a physician to get a blood test to screen for iron deficiency. Typically your doctor will look at complete blood count (CBC) measures, serum ferritin (estimate of stored iron) and possibly other specific tests to help diagnose low iron. A diagnosis of anemia often involves (1) low hemoglobin; (2) smaller than normal red blood cells; and (3) low serum ferritin. A low ferritin level alone could be an early warning sign of anemia, so athletes with low ferritin should try to increase their iron status first by increasing the iron in their diet. How Much Iron Do I Need? The Recommended Dietary Allowances for daily iron intake are as follows: Females 14-18 yrs: 15 mg Females 19-50 yrs: 18 mg Females 51+ yrs: 8 mg Males 14-18 yrs: 11 mg Males 19+ yrs: 8 mg Who Needs More? Vegetarians and vegans should try to consume more iron (up to 1.8 times more), as these recommended intakes are based on the assumption that at least 10% of iron intake is from heme iron; female athletes engaging in weight bearing activities (i.e., runners) should also try to consume more iron to account for iron losses due to foot strike; pregnancy increases demands to 27 mg. READ How Much Protein Do You Need? Getting Enough Iron with a Healthy Diet To increase your iron stores, you should consume a healthy diet that includes a wide variety of iron-containing foods. Foods contain two types of iron: heme iron is found in red meats, fish, and poultry, and non-heme iron is mostly from plant sources (enriched and whole grains, beans, nuts and some vegetables and fruit) as well as eggs and dairy products. About 60% of the iron in meat is non-heme. Here are common dietary sources of iron. How to Figure Out the Iron Content With Food Labels Figuring out the iron content of foods based on food labels is tricky. Although iron requirements vary by age and gender (and pregnancy, athletic, and vegetarian status), the Nutrition Facts Table for foods only has one value for iron. You need to look at the % daily value panel, and know what value it is based on: In Canada , this is based on 14 mg iron (so 50% daily value means 1 serving contains 7 mg iron);In the US this is based on 18 mg iron (so 50% daily value means 1 serving contains 9 mg iron). Iron Absorption How well you absorb iron might be as important as the amount that you consume. But iron absorption is a complex phenomenon: your body only absorbs about 10-15% of the iron you eat, and the amount of iron you absorb from a food is influenced by (1) your body iron status; (2) the type of iron (heme iron is better absorbed than non-heme iron); (3) iron inhibitors; and (4) iron enhancers. Iron Inhibitors are substances in foods that interfere with iron absorption (especially non-heme sources of iron). These include Calcium, dairy products, and eggs. Oxalates found in spinach, kale, beets, nuts, chocolate, tea, wheat bran, rhubarb, strawberries, and some herbs. Polyphenols – antioxidants found in some cereals and legumes, most fruits and vegetables, cocoa, coffee, tea (black, green, and herbal), some spices, and wine. Phytates – antioxidant compounds found in nuts, seeds, grains, soy proteins, and legumes. You’ll notice that this list includes many healthful foods, and the health consequences of limiting or avoiding these foods (not to mention meal-planning headaches) likely outweigh the possible iron boosting benefits of avoiding them. My advice? Focus on Iron Enhancers. Iron Enhancers Vitamin C helps your body absorb iron, and overcomes the negative influence of iron inhibitors. Some studies estimate that Vitamin C can increase iron absorption as much as four times. Try to include a vitamin-C rich food with meals and snacks. A bonus is that most vitamin-C rich foods are full of other protective nutrients important for health. This tables lists foods rich in vitamin C. Eating heme iron-rich foods with non-heme-iron rich foods helps increase iron absorption (for example, adding a small amount of meat to chili will help you absorb more iron from the beans). Carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin – found in brightly-colored fruits and vegetables like carrots, greens, sweet potatoes, red peppers, cherries, cantaloupe, oranges) improve iron uptake and help overcome the effects of iron inhibitors. Cooking in cast iron can increase the iron content of food, especially acidic foods (i.e., tomato sauce). Studies have found that the iron content of cast-iron cooked foods was 2 to 12 times higher than foods cooked in other types of pots: more acidic, high moisture foods and longer cooking times results in more iron leaching into foods. One study estimated an increased daily iron intake of 14.5 mg for adults and 7.5 mg for children eating foods cooked in cast iron pots. (Cast iron is great for other reasons too! ). Designing Meals and Snacks to Maximize Iron Absorption A main focus should be to include vitamin-C rich foods with your meals and snacks. Here are some other tips and meal ideas: A burrito or Mexican-inspired meal containing beans and rice with salsa and sweet peppers is a delicious iron-rich vitamin C combination. Add a little lean beef or chicken to increase the iron content even further. Bake with Blackstrap Molasses – it’s full of all the good stuff that’s left behind after processing sugar cane into sugar, including lots of iron and other minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Some people add 1 tbsp. to water or milk. A little can add a rich flavor to baked goods like yeast breads, quickbreads and muffins (I use 3-4 tbsp. for baking a large loaf of whole wheat bread). The flavor is intense – so experiment with just a little at first. For a pre- or after-workout snack, try trail mix with iron fortified cereal (shreddies/oat squares), dark chocolate, and dried fruit with vitamin C (mango, papaya, apricot) to increase iron absorption. Enjoy an iron-fortified breakfast cereal with fresh berries and milk or yogurt. This is a great post-workout snack too because it includes carbs and a bit of protein. Low-sugar/whole grain varieties are your best bet. Top a spinach salad with vitamin-C sources, like strawberries, or mandarin oranges, and peppers (all rich in Vitamin C). Finish off a meal with a vitamin-C rich fruit tart (try my recipe!) to improve the iron absorption of your meal. Add red peppers to any meal – they are the leading source of vitamin C to help iron absorption and full of other nutrients. Eat raw as a snack, add slices to sandwiches and wraps, dip into hummus, or cook into omelets, soups, and stews. Here are 28 iron-rich recipes from my favourite cooking magazine Eating Well. READ Fabulous Fruit Tart in a Walnut Crust Iron-Seeking Focus that Might Compromise Your Health When an athlete thinks they need to increase their iron intake, they tend to focus exclusively on this one mineral at the expense of their overall diet. Here are some things to think about: Too much red meat. Some athletes increase red meat intake considerably to boost iron levels. Although heme iron is best absorbed, eating large amounts of red meat is not recommended for overall health. Leading health organizations recommend limiting red meat intake to reduce risk of cancer , Type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. You don’t need to exclude red meat, but for overall health it’s best to consume smaller amounts and include other sources of heme iron (poultry, fish) and non-heme iron in your diet. Confusion with clams. Many reputable health websites and resources list clams as an excellent source of iron (23 mg per 3 oz; which is 6 mg more than the daily recommended allowance for women). I wouldn’t recommend eating clams often as your iron source. Recent research shows complications with this iron data, as the actual amount of iron in clams differs widely by the type of clam, and it is generally modest (1 mg per 3 oz serving for chopped of minced clam products). The study authors also found that nutrition label data for iron in clams is inaccurate, and that clams have much less heme iron than once thought. Clams with the highest iron content are baby clams, but eating large amounts of these clams is not recommended as they are high in aluminum and can accumulate cadmium and lead, contaminants that can cause adverse health effects. Too much focus on inhibitors. Many foods that limit iron absorption are extremely nutritious and important for overall health. Some people limit legumes, seeds, and nuts because of their phytate content – yet these foods are nutrition powerhouses! Although if you’re trying to maximize iron absorption you might not want to drink tea or coffee with every meal, but a focus on enhancers, especially vitamin-C rich foods, will lead to a healthier overall diet. Orange juice as main vitamin C source. For optimal nutrition, limit orange juice as your vitamin C source: it is very high in sugar and lacks the fiber to moderate the sugar absorption. Instead, eat a variety of vitamin-C rich fruits (e.g., kiwis, citrus fruits, strawberries, mangos, cantaloupe) or vegetables (red and green peppers, broccoli, greens, tomato sauce, cabbage). You’ll benefit from a wide array of health promoting substances, in addition to vitamin C to increase iron absorption. See the Table above for a variety of Vitamin-C rich fruits and vegetables. READ Healthy or Hype? Protein Powder Do I Need an Iron Supplement? If dietary measures aren’t effective for improving iron stores, iron supplementation is often considered. As iron pills often have side effects (constipation, diarrhea, stomach upset), and excess iron stores are a great health risk and associated with chronic disease, it’s important to take these supplements under the guidance of your physician. In some cases, iron injections may be considered to boost iron levels. You can find more information about iron supplements here. What if I Have Low Ferritin but Normal Hemoglobin? Many female athletes have low ferritin with normal hemoglobin levels. Some athletes and coaches believe that this status causes fatigue and may compromise aerobic capacity, and turn to iron supplements as a way to increase energy and improve race times. It is currently unclear whether or not iron supplementation will improve aerobic capacity in athletes with low ferritin without anemia, but research is ongoing. A small number of studies suggest that iron supplementation may reduce fatigue in women with low ferritin, but results have been mixed, and again, more research is needed. The optimal ferritin level for athletes is widely debated: many studies use a ferritin level of <12 mcg/L to define iron deficiency, although benefits of iron supplementation have been shown using higher ferritin cut-offs (up to 60 mcg/l). Some experts believe that ferritin and hemoglobin levels are relative (i.e., one athlete may be fine with hemoglobin level of 13 g/dl, while another may be anemic at this level). Consider this Olympic 1500m runner who improved steadily despite depleted iron stores (low ferritin levels). If your iron stores are normal, there is little robust evidence to suggest that taking iron supplements will improve aerobic capacity or reduce fatigue. In fact, this practice is risky because excess iron is associated with health problems. Fatigue has many causes, and it’s important to consider the athlete’s training plan, life stressors, sleep, diet (i.e., restricting calories and/or carbohydrates), and other factors – in addition to iron status – that might be contributing to fatigue.

I know about egg white facemasks, but a myth I heard was that eating eggs could cause more acne, but I think its wrong, does anyone know? Follow 13 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: Organic eggs should be fine. You have to attack acne where it starts, with your diet. For me, diet was the cause and solution. Topical medications fight the symptoms. Start by eliminating trans fats and eating more fruits and vegetables. Once you start cleaning up the inside of your body, by eating properly, the outside of your body (your skin) will be get cleaned up too. I started a website to document my problem and solution. http://www.fredstown.com/acne.html You might find it helpful to read my story. Just remember to eat an all natural/organic diet with lots of fruits and vegetables. Stay away from processed foods. Use mild, all natural cleansers and don't pick at your face. Get lots of sleep and enough water for your body weight. Remember, clean body = clean skin. While you're waiting for your skin to clear, remind yourself that acne is a challenge that you will overcome soon. Once you're rid of it, tell all your friends how you did it. That's what I'm doing.

Ih BLi · 2 years ago0 0 Comment Dry and/or greasy skin due to poor oil composition of the skin. Thick greasy oils clog pores, lack of oil leads to dryness and irritation. You need thin oils to moisturize while dissolving and clearing gunk in your poors. Try fish oil or seafood. 2 tsp fish oil a day or 4 servings of seafood a week. Stick it out for at least 2 months; it will take a long time to replace all your oil. Any effect after 1-2 days is temporary or random; so even if it makes you break out a little at first, you haven't given it a full try yet. In the short term you can wash and moisturize well, but that will only go so far. Plus excessive washing can be drying and excessive moisturizing can be clogging. Use a small amount of a light moisturizer, made with oil not jelly or grease. Often that means soybean oil or mineral oil. Mineral oil means mined from the ground. So soybean oil is usually better, though mineral oil won't cause too much harm. Clean with soap and water, not a harsh acne cleanser. Even then they only work so well. So you really need the seafood. Antibiotics aren't really good for bacteria long term, they'll come back in force after. Short term they may help. After you get off them find some kefir with acidophilus listed first or 2nd to replace the friendly bacteria they destroyed. Studies show less illness when you have these bacteria, even outside the stomach in places such as the lungs and elsewhere. You want friendly bacteria to fill the void when the antibiotics stop, not harmful ones. In the short term you might also try 100,000+ iu retinol vitamin A (a megadose, and too much for normal use) or one of the acne drugs that is similar to retinol vitamin A. It's some minor harm to your organs, but it helps against bacteria on your skin. At least it doesn't have the other long term drawbacks to your skin that antibiotics and many scrubs do. If you would like to learn how to treat your acne permanently and regain your health and wellbeing, without drugs, without typical acne treatments, and without any side effects, then this will be the most important letter you will ever read.

Also find out if you have a bacterial, fungal or inflammation issue when it comes to acne. There are different ways to treat each. Find a Chinese dermatologist that can help along with your western dermatologist. Taking strong western drugs will keep you blood acidic which will keep the problem going even if you don t see it for a bit. So make sure to eat cooling foods.

            "Text: Daily Dose: The 6 Vitamins You (Really) Need7 COMMENTS 2010 February 15Dr. Tanya Edwards reveals the vitamins every over-fifty woman needs to feel truly fab. (We’ll have a shopping list for you at the end. )The Multi What’s the most important vitamin that everyone should be taking? A multivitamin. Because none of us get 100 percent of everything that we absolutely need. Our standard American diet is grossly lacking in so many things. Are all multi-vitamins the same? I prefer a whole food multi vitamin. They’re made from food as opposed to synthetics. The theory–and this is based on theory and not necessarily clinical trials–is that whole food vitamins are in the proportions that you find in food and contain enzymes to help those vitamins work together. More like nature wants it. How do you know if a vitamin is “whole food”? If it doesn’t say it right on the packaging, then it’s not. What if you’re a very healthy eater—do you still need supplements? Even if your diet has plenty of fruits and vegetables, there have been so many changes in our U. S. farming practices, that often the soil is depleted of the minerals you need. The other issue is, much of our produce is shipped from far away. When produce is shipped, it has to be picked before it’s ripe, so it doesn’t have all the nutrients that it should. If a banana ripens en route to your grocery store, it’s not gaining the nutrients that it would have gained if it were ripening on the tree. I’ve noticed some multis have iron and some don’t—does it matter? If you are over 50 and still menstruating, you should take a multi with iron. If you’ve stopped menstruating, you should take one without iron—as long as you’re not anemic. Most multis with iron contain the recommended daily dose–18 milligrams per day. If you take more than the recommended dosage of something, is that bad? It can be for a lot of vitamins, including iron. Having extra iron in your body can act as a catalyst for oxidation–the production of free radicals. Those are the bad guys that cause disease. So having exactly the amount of iron that you need–no more, no less–is really important. Fish Oil Why should we take fish oil? Because we are all deficient in omega 3 fatty acids. What do those do? Omega 3s are one of two essential fats our bodies need. The other is omega 6. We get way too many omega 6s in our diets and not nearly enough omega 3s. That tips the balance and causes inflammation. Omega 3s are highly anti-inflammatory. Where do we get all these omega 6s? Omega 6s are found in many nuts and seeds and also vegetables, vegetable oil and corn oil. Thirty years ago, when we were told to stop using lard in cooking, we all switched to vegetable oils. Now we have a lot of vegetable oils in our diets. That’s not to say that omega 6s are not important. Our immune system uses them to mount a response and kill off viruses, bugs, cancer cells and those kinds of things. But omega 3s are your counter balance. They help to dampen the immune response. If you are eating way too many omega 6s and not enough omega 3s, your inflammatory response goes unabated. And what happens in your body? You have inflammation, which has proven to be the underlying cause of just about all of the diseases that we suffer from: heart attacks, strokes, cancer, high blood pressure and diabetes. So I better run out and get this fish oil. Absolutely. What about flax seed oil? Isn’t that omega 3? I don’t recommend flax seed oil as your omega 3. That’s the short chain omega 3; you need the long chain that is found only either in fish or algae. Algae? My vegan patients take an algae supplement, otherwise I recommend fish oil. Vitamin DTell me why people need D. D comes from the sun, but in the last 50 years our society has gone indoors. We were supposed to be outside, scantily clothed. As we’ve moved further away from the equator and indoors, we are not getting nearly enough. Fifteen years ago we thought vitamin D was only related to calcium in bone density, but now we know it’s related to hundreds of diseases. If you’re deficient, you have an increased risk for heart attack, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, autism, high blood pressure…But you wouldn’t develop autism as an adult, would you? No, no, no. But if you are pregnant and vitamin D deficient, you never know . . . So should everyone be taking a vitamin D supplement? No. You should get your blood tested first to find out how deficient you are. Then have it retested every three months so that your doctor can make sure the supplement you’re taking is exactly the amount you need to take all year round, regardless of the season. When I get a full blood workup, is my D level automatically tested? Probably not. It depends on how enlightened your physician is. Oh my God, I’m calling him immediately. Your vitamin D level needs to be between 50 and 80. How many milligrams should we be taking? It has to be tailored to you. I have some patients whose levels are maintained on 1,000 units a day. Other patients require 10,000 units a day. Could too much vitamin D hurt me? It could, depending on how much you take. If you’re taking 1,000 or 2,000 units a day, I wouldn’t worry about it. But more than that, and you could become vitamin D toxic. The symptoms of too much vitamin D are abdominal pain and lethargy. So if I don’t have either of those I shouldn’t worry. No. Calcium All women over 50 need 500 milligrams of calcium twice a day, preferably with food. Why twice a day as opposed to all at once? Your body won’t absorb more than 500-600 milligrams of calcium at one time. If you take them both at the same time then you will poop out the rest. If you eat a lot of dairy in your diet, do you still need calcium? If you’re getting a lot of dairy in your diet–which by the way I don’t necessarily recommend–add up the milligrams of calcium that you are getting from food. Maybe you don’t in fact need extra calcium. You would need about three servings of a dairy product everyday. What’s the recommended daily dose of calcium?1,000mg. Unless you have osteoporosis, in which case it’s 1500. If you start taking calcium when you’re 60 will it mean you won’t get osteoporosis? No. But it may decrease the progression of your osteoporosis. If you start taking calcium when you’re 30, does that help you prevent getting osteoporosis? Yes, it does. I recommended that all adults, period, get about 1,000 milligrams of calcium, whether it’s in your diet or as a supplement everyday. So my daughter, who is 28, doesn’t eat cheese, she may drink a little milk, she doesn’t eat ice cream. I better have her start taking calcium. Yeah. In addition to dairy products you can get calcium from other foods as well. Dark green, leafy vegetables have calcium. She doesn’t eat those either. Her diet is god-awful. Broccoli is one of the best non-dairy sources of calcium. Magnesium Why magnesium?85 percent of Americans do not get enough magnesium in their diets. What does it come from? The best source of magnesium is a grain called amaranth. One serving of amaranth per day provides your recommended daily allowance of magnesium. Two servings of pumpkin seeds or sunflower seeds, also provide that dose. Dark green, leafy vegetables and whole grains and nuts are also sources, but they give you about 1/10th or 1/15th of your recommended daily allowance, so you’ve got to eat a lot. What’s the recommended daily dosage?400. What happens with a low magnesium level? Symptoms of decreased magnesium are headaches–particularly migraine headaches–Charlie horses, fatigue. Other symptoms are constipation and elevated blood pressure. Can I get it from a supplement? Check your multivitamin. Most don’t have it. If that’s the case, just take it separately. If I have a patient with symptoms of low magnesium. I usually recommend about 500 milligrams at bedtime because magnesium will help you sleep. Resveratrol And what is resveratrol? Resveratrol is one of the newest kids on the block. It’s the antioxidant in red wine. Is that something you’d recommend people take? I’m seriously thinking about it. There are some very compelling new resveratrol studies showing decreases in oxidation, cholesterol and abdominal fat. In a study a year or so ago, rats who took resveratrol lived significantly longer than rats who didn’t, and they did not age the same way as the rats who didn’t take it. I think more information needs to come out–large studies on humans. But you’re looking at it? Oh yeah, seriously.

There is real concern and research showing that folic acid supplements, always found in these multi-vitamins, are not needed. They may in fact be increasing colon polyps which may become cancerous. When mandatory supplementation in grains was passed, folic acid was added to decrease neural tube defects - it worked but may be to the detriment to other populations. The whole foods vitamins are just another way to increase the price and get people to purchase. Resveratrol, outside of food sources, have not been shown to be beneficial.

Iron is a mineral that the body needs for growth and development. Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body, and myoglobin, a protein that provides oxygen to muscles. Your body also needs iron to make some hormones and connective tissue. How much iron do I need? The amount of iron you need each day depends on your age, your sex, and whether you consume a mostly plant-based diet. Average daily recommended amounts are listed below in milligrams (mg). Vegetarians who do not eat meat, poultry, or seafood need almost twice as much iron as listed in the table because the body doesn’t absorb nonheme iron in plant foods as well as heme iron in animal foods. Life Stage Recommended Amount Birth to 6 months 0.27 mg Infants 7-12 months 11 mg Children 1-3 years 7 mg Children 4-8 years 10 mg Children 9-13 years 8 mg Teens boys 14-18 years 11 mg Teens girls 14-18 years 15 mg Adult men 19-50 years 8 mg Adult women 19-50 years 18 mg Adults 51 years and older 8 mg Pregnant teens 27 mg Pregnant women 27 mg Breastfeeding teens 10 mg Breastfeeding women 9 mg What foods provide iron? Iron is found naturally in many foods and is added to some fortified food products. You can get recommended amounts of iron by eating a variety of foods, including the following: Lean meat, seafood, and poultry. Iron-fortified breakfast cereals and breads. White beans, lentils, spinach, kidney beans, and peas. Nuts and some dried fruits, such as raisins. Iron in food comes in two forms: heme iron and nonheme iron. Nonheme iron is found in plant foods and iron-fortified food products. Meat, seafood, and poultry have both heme and nonheme iron. Your body absorbs iron from plant sources better when you eat it with meat, poultry, seafood, and foods that contain vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, strawberries, sweet peppers, tomatoes, and broccoli. What kinds of iron dietary supplements are available? Iron is available in many multivitamin-mineral supplements and in supplements that contain only iron. Iron in supplements is often in the form of ferrous sulfate, ferrous gluconate, ferric citrate, or ferric sulfate. Dietary supplements that contain iron have a statement on the label warning that they should be kept out of the reach of children. Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Am I getting enough iron? Most people in the United States get enough iron. However, certain groups of people are more likely than others to have trouble getting enough iron: Teen girls and women with heavy periods. Pregnant women and teens. Infants (especially if they are premature or low-birthweight ). Frequent blood donors. People with cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, or heart failure. What happens if I don’t get enough iron? In the short term, getting too little iron does not cause obvious symptoms. The body uses its stored iron in the muscles, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. But when levels of iron stored in the body become low, iron deficiency anemia sets in. Red blood cells become smaller and contain less hemoglobin. As a result, blood carries less oxygen from the lungs throughout the body. Symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include tiredness and lack of energy, GI upset, poor memory and concentration, and less ability to fight off germs and infections or to control body temperature. Infants and children with iron deficiency anemia might develop learning difficulties. Iron deficiency is not common in the United States. But it can occur in people who do not eat meat, poultry, or seafood; lose blood; have GI diseases that interfere with nutrient absorption; or eat poor diets. What are some effects of iron on health? Scientists are studying iron to understand how it affects health. Iron’s most important contribution to health is preventing iron deficiency anemia and resulting problems. Pregnant women During pregnancy, the amount of blood in a woman’s body increases, so she needs more iron for herself and her growing baby. Getting too little iron during pregnancy increases a woman’s risk of iron deficiency anemia and her infant’s risk of low birthweight, premature birth, and low levels of iron. Getting too little iron might also harm her infant’s brain development. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should take an iron supplement as recommended by an obstetrician or other healthcare provider. Infants and toddlers Iron deficiency anemia in infancy can lead to delayed psychological development, social withdrawal, and less ability to pay attention. By age 6 to 9 months, full-term infants could become iron deficient unless they eat iron- enriched solid foods or drink iron-fortified formula. Anemia of chronic disease Some chronic diseases—such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and some types of cancer—can interfere with the body’s ability to use its stored iron. Taking more iron from foods or supplements usually does not reduce the resulting anemia of chronic disease because iron is diverted from the blood circulation to storage sites. The main therapy for anemia of chronic disease is treatment of the underlying disease. Can iron be harmful? Yes, iron can be harmful if you get too much. In healthy people, taking high doses of iron supplements (especially on an empty stomach) can cause an upset stomach, constipation, nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fainting. High doses of iron can also decrease zinc absorption. Extremely high doses of iron (in the hundreds or thousands of mg) can cause organ failure, coma, convulsions, and death. Child-proof packaging and warning labels on iron supplements have greatly reduced the number of accidental iron poisonings in children. Some people have an inherited condition called hemochromatosis that causes toxic levels of iron to build up in their bodies. Without medical treatment, people with hereditary hemochromatosis can develop serious problems such as liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and heart disease. People with this disorder should avoid using iron supplements and vitamin C supplements. The upper limits for iron from foods and dietary supplements are listed below. A doctor might prescribe more than the upper limit of iron to people who need higher doses for a while to treat iron deficiency. Ages Upper Limit Birth to 12 months 40 mg Children 1-13 years 40 mg Teens 14-18 years 45 mg Adults 19+ years 45 mg Are there any interactions with iron that I should know about? Yes, iron supplements can interact or interfere with medicines and other supplements you take. Here are several examples: Iron supplements can reduce the amount of levodopa that the body absorbs, making it less effective. Levodopa, found in Sinemet® and Stalevo®, is used to treat Parkinson’s diseas e and restless leg syndrome. Taking iron with levothyroxine can reduce this medication’s effectiveness. Levothyroxine (Levothroid®, Levoxyl®, Synthroid®, Tirosint®, and Unithroid®) is used to treat hypothyroidism, goiter, and thyroid cancer. The proton pump inhibitors lansoprazole (Prevacid®) and omeprazole (Prilosec®) decrease stomach acid, so they might reduce the amount of nonheme iron that the body absorbs from food. Calcium might interfere with iron absorption. Taking calcium and iron supplements at different times of the day might prevent this problem. Tell your doctor, pharmacist, and other healthcare providers about any dietary supplements and prescription or over-the-counter medicines you take. They can tell you if the dietary supplements might interact with your medicines or if the medicines might interfere with how your body absorbs, uses, or breaks down nutrients. Iron and healthful eating People should get most of their nutrients from food, advises the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Foods contain vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber and other substances that benefit health. In some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements may provide nutrients that otherwise may be consumed in less-than-recommended amounts.

            "Text: 4How to Find Your Half Marathon Race Pace If you have a half-marathon looming in the near future, you have likely considered what pace you should run on race day. This is a critical question that may determine whether you run the faster race you ever have, or whether you run out of gas in the final few miles. This can often be a difficult question if this is your first half marathon. However, if you have run multiple half-marathon before this becomes much easier to determine. The key to finding your best half marathon race day pace is to listen to your body during training runs, and to complete at least one or 2 prep races. This topic is a particular concern of mine right now, because I happen to be running a half-marathon in just over a month ( Labor Day Half Marathon in Redmond, WA on Sept. 2nd). In addition, I will be using my time on this half marathon to determine my pace for my full marathon in 2 months ( Leavenworth marathon on October 5th ). Testing Your Pace During Training The key to being more accurate in your race day predictions is to have solid workouts. There are many different half marathon training plans out there, but most of them will consist of some long runs, tempo runs, and speed/interval training. Each of these workouts have their place in developing the strength needed to finish well. However, tempo runs are the most important run to help you determine what your pace should be. A tempo run, can be described in several different ways, but for the most part its around a 3 to 5 mile steady pace run at your 10k to half marathon goal pace. The 10k pace would only be used if you are training solely for a half marathon. Since, I’m personally “really” training for a full marathon, I run my tempo runs at slightly faster than my half marathon goal base, but never quite at my 10k pace. For example, I am running a half marathon in about a month. My goal is to get 1:37:35 or a 7:27 per mile pace. As such, I try to run my tempo runs at a pace between 7:20 to 7:27 per mile. However, this is really my training for a full marathon. If my half marathon was my end goal; I may actually train a bit faster and run my tempo runs between 7:10 to 7:20. If you are not about to run 3 or 4 miles at this pace; you should start to be concerned that you’ve set too ambitious of a goal!So, is your body telling you that you are running your tempo runs too fast? If you are struggling to run 3 to 5 miles at just a little faster than half marathon pace, you should consider revising your goal. On the other hand, if you are able to breeze through your tempo runs; perhaps you should adjust your goal and train a bit harder!Using Tune-up Races to Find Your Pace However, even better than just using a tempo run, is to use another race. So, if you are preparing for a half-marathon, a 10k race would be great to run about a month before your half. Then you can take your finishing time from this 10k and plug it in to the Mc Millan calculator or other calculators to help you determine what your half marathon goal pace should be. For example, I am running the Railroad Days 10k Race on August 17th to help me determine what kind of shape I’m in and at what pace I should run my half marathon. If I run the 10k race at a 7:10 pace (44:31 finishing time), the Mc Millan calculator predicts that I could run a half marathon at 1:39:15. Obviously a lot of different factors go into determining the final outcome of a race; but using a tune up race can really help you get a good feel for where your goal pace should be. So, if I can only run a 10k in a time of 44:31, the chances of running below 1:37:35 becomes pretty slim. However, a time of 1:39:00 would be very realistic. I would be able to predict that most likely I am going to finish a half marathon between 1:37 and 1:39. In this particular case, I would probably set a pace at a 1:38:00 finishing time and let the last 5k dictate whether I speed up towards the end. So, if you have run a 10k “tune up” race about a month before your half marathon, you can usually predict within a couple of minutes what your half marathon finishing time will be. I personally would not try to go much more than 2 minutes faster than what the Mc Millan calculator predicts – until the end of the race. If you are feeling great the last 5k, then by all means give it what you have and finish faster!But you don’t want to make the mistake of going out faster than your body can handle only to dramatically slow down about half way through, and finish MUCH slower than you wanted or expected. If you are looking to run a half marathon under 2 hours, I’ve written some similar analysis for getting that pace. Your Thoughts Overall, this is the type of process that I go through to find my half marathon pace time. I highly recommend that you run a 10k or other race before your official half marathon. This will be your best predictor. However, if you are unable to do so, you can also use tempo runs to determine your overall fitness level. Then as you run more and more half marathons, you will be able to look at your past racing history and know how you run to predict an even more accurate time than any online calculator ever could do. If you have anything that you would like to add to the discussion, I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments section below!Spencer Haws Updated 24 Jan Categories ↓\n",

            "Text: Half Marathon Marathon Running Start Running Training Tips How Far Should You Run Before a Half Marathon or Marathon? I’ve had a few readers ask me different questions about training for your first half marathon, including questions about how far should you run before a half marathon. Since this is a common question also for both beginner and experienced marathons and half marathoners alike, let’s look at what popular training plans recommend. A half marathon (13.1 miles) and full marathon (26.2 miles) both require long runs as an essential part of your training. These are endurance events, so you need to build your endurance in order to successfully cross the finish line. The best way to build endurance is through long runs—runs that last 90 minutes or longer. Almost every half marathon and marathon plan out there calls for one long run per week, usually on Saturday or Sunday. How far these long runs are depends on your level of fitness going into training, goals for the race, and which training philosophy you are following. How far should you run before a half marathon? The Hansons Half-Marathon Method Beginner Plan calls for long runs up to 12 miles. For most of the plan, you alternate between a long run of 10 miles and a long run of 12 miles each week. The Hal Higdon Novice 1 Half Marathon Training Plan peaks at a 10 mile long run the week before the race. His Novice 2 Half Marathon plan includes a 12 mile long run the week before the race. The Jeff Galloway Run-Walk Half Marathon beginner plan brings runners up to 14 miles (with run/walk intervals) two weeks before the race. The First-Time Half Marathoners Plan on Runner’s World has you run 12 miles as your longest run before the race. As a certified running coach, I recommend 12 miles for new runners and up to 15 miles for experienced runners. So most of these training plans take you to 12 miles before the half marathon. There’s only a 9% increase in distance from 12 miles to 13.1 miles; tapering and the adrenaline of race day will carry you for the final 1.1 miles. If you are running your first half marathon with a time goal, you will probably want to run 13-14 miles before your race to get your body more comfortable with the distance. You will also benefit from doing several 10-12 mile long runs with fartlek intervals, tempo segments at goal pace, or progressions. If you are running a half marathon as your first race or are a novice runner (less than a year of running), you want to give yourself adequate time to build up to your long runs. For example, if you are currently running 3-4 miles a few times a week, spend a few weeks before you start your training building up to 8 miles by adding a mile to one run each week (or find a plan that starts with long runs on the lower end). There’s no need to run your long runs as fast as you want to run the race! Tapering and adrenaline will also help you run faster on race day. If you have a time goal, aim to run your long runs about 1 minute per mile slower than your goal race pace. What about the marathon? Many runners say that the marathon is more than just twice the distance of the half marathon, so you can’t just double your training from the half marathon. Running a marathon requires that you train smart, since running 26.2 miles is a huge stress on the body. While you can run up to or even over 13 miles in half marathon training, you do not want to run up to or over 26 miles in marathon training, especially if you are training for your first marathon. How far should you run before a marathon? The Hansons Marathon Method maxes out at 16 miles for the long run. Don’t be deceived; this plan has you running six days a week, you run 8-10 miles on the day before the long runs, and these 16 milers are done at a moderate pace instead of the traditional long slow distance easy pace. The Hal Higdon Novice 1 Marathon and Novice 2 plans both call for one 20 mile long run before the race. The Jeff Galloway Marathon Plan takes you all the way up to 26 miles, but all long runs are done using the run walk method. The First Timers Marathon Plan available on the Runner’s World website caps at 20 mile long runs. As a coach, I recommend 20 miles. It’s not just your aerobic endurance that you need to train; your mental strength, fatigue resistance, and stomach all need to be trained to handle the demands of the marathon. At first, you may be tempted to run the whole 26 miles before the race, but that effort could exhaust you so much that the race itself is difficult to finish. Many coaches believe that running for longer than 3 hours has diminishing returns, which is why they c ap the marathon long run at 20 miles for most runners (which is still longer than 3 hours for many beginners). As with half marathon training, you want to choose a marathon training plan that begins at your current level of fitness or spend a few weeks before you begin training increasing your weekly long run. Whether you are training for a half or full marathon, it is important to remember that long runs put a lot of stress on your body. If you push too fast in your long runs or take on too much distance too soon, you sharply increase your risk of injury and burnout. Be sure to safely increase your mileage as you train. The famous running coach Jack Daniels advises that long runs comprise only about 20-30% of your weekly mileage, since the more miles you run, the more your body is used to the stress of running. This is why the Hansons Method only goes up to 16 miles in the middle of 60+ mile weeks. While some runners find that too high mileage leads to injury, just be mindful that you have a strong running base and most of your weekly miles aren’t coming from a single run.

Its been a while since I trained for a half (I usually run them while training for a full) so I usually feel comfortable completing the distance. It will be interesting when I start to think about doing another half at some point and need to build back up to double digits!Reply Laura Norris says April 24, 2015 at 5:05 pm I bet running a half while training for a full makes the distance much easier! I’m considering running a half during my marathon training – is it something you’d recommend? Reply Eric says January 8, 2018 at 10:25 pm Yes but you also need to run atleast 20 to 24 miles during training.it is crucial.the last 6 miles are all mental.ive run 7 marathons so good luck Replyjpicko says April 6, 2018 at 1:45 pm Agreed. I don’t think they really correlate that much, the marathon is all about those last 6-7 miles which can be brutal, esp for a more novice runner. The half feels more like an actual race and I’m not sure running a slower 18-22 miler pace 5-6 times would help. Would be better prepared for the half running more shorter distances at a faster pace and tempo. I ran a marathon first, then a half a few months later (with a 12 week training program). My half marathon pace was almost 2:00 minutes faster per mile than my marathon pace. Why? Well, of course you are going to run a bit slower, but also, those last 6-8 miles can be brutal mixed walking/hobbling and raise your total pace. They are different races really and I say this as just a novice runner. For more elite runners used to running it might not matter as much, but beware those last miles : D. Reply Meghan @ getoffyourbuttandrun says April 24, 2015 at 11:03 am I had a 22 miler last weekend and a 23 miler this weekend. That is definitely the furthest I’ve ever trained for a race. In past training cycles I was lucky if I ran 18. This training period has been much better!Reply Laura Norris says April 24, 2015 at 4:55 pm That’s awesome that you’re having a great training period! 22 and 23 miles are very much something to be proud of in training!Reply Maddie @ Dixie Runs says April 24, 2015 at 12:53 pm I’ve done one 11 mile run and my half marathon is 3 weeks away. I’m going to try for one 12-13 mile run before the race, just so I can feel confident enough on race day. Thanks for this advice.. it’s really helpful!! Racing a new distance is so scary… you have no idea what to expect. Reply Laura Norris says April 24, 2015 at 4:54 pm I’m glad you found it helpful! Even if you’re fitness is there, racing is so mental/emotional that extra confidence builders do help! New distances are scary – I’m already nervous/excited about my first marathon in October!Reply Jess says April 24, 2015 at 5:37 pm Wish you had written this post before my first half back in 2013 This is a great overview. I really loved working with my running coach up until my injury but I’m undecided what I’ll do in the future. The accountability really helped during the icy, cold, snowy winter months. Also, do I sense an announcement soon about becoming a running coach? Read through that “yet” in the disclaimer Reply Laura Norris says April 24, 2015 at 10:13 pm I do plan on signing up for an RRCA seminar once they announce their West Coast dates! It will probably be somewhere in the fall, but it’s something I’ve been wanting to do for almost a year now (once I decided Ph D was not the path for me). Reply Annie kibbee says September 16, 2015 at 11:18 pm I ran a 1/2 marathon at the end of may, and I will be running another one sept 20… in 4 days time. I have ran several long 2hour runs on the weekends during the summer along with 2or 3 weekday 10km runs. I did a 2hr run last weekend then a 45 mins slow run two days ago. I am just wondering what I should run in these remaining days before the race. Please let’s know. Thanks. Reply Laura Norris says September 17, 2015 at 2:39 am Hi, Annie! In days before you’re race it’s wise to cut back a bit on your mileage as a taper. If you do 2-3 10KM runs per week, try cutting back to 2-3 6-8KM at an easy pace during the days leading up to the race, on the same days as you did them throughout training. I hope this helps!Reply Darrell Romero says October 5, 2015 at 6:03 pm My first half marathon is next weekend. My training peaked at just under 12 miles, which was yesterday. Prior to that it has been one long run a week with 2-3 three to six mile runs mixed in depending on how my body reacted. I did have a 10 mile race a week ago, which did teach me a valuable lesson about pace and keeping to my plan in the hysteria. I have received mixed opinions about adding the 12 miles yesterday, however I feel it did raise my confidence. Reply Laura Norris says October 6, 2015 at 12:33 am That’s good that the 12 miles raised your confidence! Some may not suggest doing that long of a run so close to your marathon, but how you build your pre-race confidence can make such a difference. I hope you half goes well!Reply New Runner says August 10, 2017 at 1:01 pm I started to train for a half marathon and “fell of the wagon.” After four weeks of running four days a week and then month of not keeping up adequate runs (running once or twice a week with no long runs) I’m wondering if I could still do the half marathon in 9 days. My longest run was 10 miles. Definitely not ideal but wondering if its feasible. Reply Laura Norris says August 10, 2017 at 1:24 pm Several other factors play in: what is your general level of fitness? Were you doing cross-training during this time? To be honest, it may be in your best interest to not do the half – it may be feasible, but it will likely not be pleasant and you want to enjoy your first race! 4 weeks of training followed by 4 weeks of no long runs is not enough aerobic base – generally, 12-16 weeks of training is ideal for first-time half marathoners – and depending on how long you had been running before training for the half, you could place yourself at risk for injury. If you do chose to do the half, then I would encourage you to try run-walk intervals during the race to avoid hitting a wall. Best of luck on whatever you decide!Reply Jo says August 29, 2017 at 10:13 am More a question than a comment: I have been told that the distance you run in a week, you can pull together in a day. So e.g. if you run 10km a day for 3 days in a week, you could effectively run 30km in one day. How true is this? Reply Leave a Reply Your email address will not be published.

            "Text: Monday, May 13, 2013 by Jeff Sanders How to Train for Your First Half Marathonby Jeff Sanders — Get free updates of new posts here. The half marathon is the most popular distance for a reason – it`s a good challenge while also being MUCH easier than a full marathon. Photo Credit: Jeff Sanders Between training runs and official races, I have run a half marathon distance more than 50 times. The 13.1-miles was daunting at first, but it quickly became my favorite distance. Here's how to train for your first half marathon. Why a Half Marathon? To the average person, running 13 miles sounds crazy. It takes about two hours on average to finish if you are in good shape and you could spend months preparing for your first race. Here's the good news: half marathons are not that hard. In fact, they are considerably easier than a full marathon at 26.2 miles. If I had to guess, I would say that the full marathon is about 4 times harder than the half. For some reason, once you hit “the wall” around mile 20, your body turns into a war zone and it takes real strength to push to the finish. Thankfully, it is highly unlikely you will hit the wall if you train well for the half marathon. How to Get Started I was not a good runner when I started. In fact, I was overweight, drinking like a sailor, and couldn't run one mile without stopping for a much-needed break. Keep that in mind as you overcome your own set of excuses. It doesn't matter how busy you are, how slow you run, or if you can even run at all. Running is a learned skill – not a natural talent. Acknowledge where you are. The biggest mistake you can make in the beginning is over-estimating your abilities, which only leads to injuries and giving up the goal altogether. Go out for a really easy run today. Don't wait. The excuses are already building as you read this sentence. To increase the momentum, you need to get started – now. Create an achievable weekly goal. Get out your calendar and find 3 blocks of time each week when you can run. I recommend running in the morningbecause you are more likely to succeed early in the day. Run short distances with plenty of walk breaks. The real key to training for a long distance run is to make running easy and fun. Do what it takes to maintain your love for running as you train. If you hate training, what are the odds you will one day cross the finish line? Variety is key. Run on the roads, trails, treadmills, and in your living room. Don't forget yoga, strength training, and volleyball. Cross-training is great to make you a better overall athlete and a better runner. Start to think of yourself as a runner. Ask yourself, would a marathon runner go out for a run in the rain, or the snow, or at 4 am? Answer: yes. Yes, runners just run. The weather only affects what you wear, not whether or not your will run. Slowly increase your long runs. Pick one day a week when you will do a long run. I like Saturday mornings. Start with a long run around 3 miles and then slowly increase that distance each week. For example, the first week could be 3.0 miles, second week 3.5 miles, third week 4.0 miles, etc. Here's my anti-advice. I'm not going to tell you to do what most runners and trainers will advise, which is to sign up for a race and then set a training schedule to hit that target date. On the contrary, you should train consistentlyand easily, eat a healthy diet with lot's of fruit, and build your strength slowly over time. Then, when your body is ready, sign up for a race that is coming up soon. I use a Heart Rate Training system as outlined in a great book called Heart Rate Training. I highly recommend this system as a slow and effective method to become a great runner. How Fast Should I Run 13.1 Miles? As a point of reference, the St. Louis Half Marathon (pictured above) was my fastest half marathon to date. I finished that race in 1 hour and 44 minutes. I don't run for speed. It's rare for me to try to beat someone else on a race course because I don't run to win. I run for fun. Your finish time will depend on many factors, but the average finish time is around two hours. The elite Olympians finish in about one hour while the slowest runners normally stroll in around four hours. You will quickly be able to calculate your approximate finish time as you train. For example, an average of 9-minutes per mile will result in a finish time of 1 hour and 58 minutes. How long will this process take? It's hard to give a definite time frame because there are many variables to consider (your running experience, current level of ability, schedule, determination, etc.). However, assuming you are starting from scratch – meaning you are somewhat overweight with a mediocre diet and running is a foreign language – this could take anywhere from 3-6 months. I recommend 6-12 months. Slower really is better. I can't tell you how many times I have injured myself because I pushed myself too hard, too fast. Don't do that to yourself. Your heart and lungs will adjust quickly to running, but your ligaments, tendons, and joints will adapt over a much longer period of time. As another point of reference, if you finish a run and you are severely out of breath – you ran too hard. If your heart is pounding through your chest – you ran too hard. If you finish a training run and you are NOT smiling – you ran too hard!Run slow, run easy, and run for fun!Your First Step Go out for an easy run or fast walk today. The best first step to prepare for running is to move your body. That may seem obvious, but many people ask me running advice before they have even run a single mile. Start small and let the momentum build. Resources Here a few other posts I have written about running that could be helpful.

            "Text: In this category I’ll discuss being overweight and running and all of the issues you might encounter. How To Start Running When You’re Overweight Start small and make yourself some realistic goals to get back into shape. The key here is to longevity. If you try to lose weight too quickly with running, then you’ll face burning out and stopping running altogether. If you take things slowly and set realistic short and long term goals then you’re more likely to succeed in the long run. I set myself the goal of running the Belfast Marathon 2011 when I first started. This seemed ambitious at the time but it really motivated me into trying to get fit. This Is How I Started Running When I Was Fat When I started training for the marathon I was around 230lbs. For a 6’2″ man, that’s at least 30lbs overweight. I started by running on the treadmill at the local gym to try to take the impact off my knees. Going into a gym when you’re overweight is difficult. You think that everyone is staring in you, when in reality they’re likely wrapped up in their own insecurities!I dreaded making the transition from gym to the streets as I was still insecure about my body and receiving abuse from idiots. One of the biggest problems I have is with passers-by calling me a ‘fat bastard’ out of their car window. I try to ignore this, mainly as the person giving me the abuse is way fatter than me and probably couldn’t run the length of themselves. Runners knee and shin splints are major issues that you might encounter if you step up your training too much at first. If you’re an overweight runner, it’s imperative that you increase your training volume by 10% each week at first. The question I’m asked most often must be ‘Is running good for overweight people?’My answer is that there is little better for long term weight loss! Once you start to enjoy running as a part of your lifestyle, then you’re much more likely to keep the weight off in the long run. Can Fat People Run Marathons? Overweight people finish marathons every week. There is no reason why you can’t be one either!Whilst running with excess weight makes things harder, it isn’t the be all and end in terms of performance. If you can run 5K (3.1 miles) easily and then follow an 18 week marathon training schedule then you can overcome your weight issues and finish a marathon. Whilst training for the marathon in 2011, I used the excellent Non Runners Marathon Trainer. It’s a great entry level book, but I found the training program to be a little too relaxed. I took the minimum daily run distances and increased them by a mile each time. All of the distances in the schedule below are in miles and are taken from the Non Runners Marathon Trainer. Following this plan loosely helped me incredibly. It’s great that it has such a low entry point in terms of mileage, but don’t let that fool you. To run a great first marathon you have to balance covering as many miles as you can without injuring yourself. The key to success is to take the training week by week. If you look at all of the miles you have to run towards the end of the schedule then you’ll freak out. At the start of my training program I couldn’t have conceived running 8 miles let alone doing 18. Just focus on what’s required this week and progress onwards from there. That’s why I recommend building your base as much as possible in the first few weeks of training, so that you have something to build upon over the mid and late weeks of marathon preparation. Focus on distance more than pace in your first marathon sessions. Don’t set yourself a time target as you quite literally won’t know what’s hit you towards the end of the race!What Are The Best Running Shoes For Someone Who Is Overweight? You can’t go far wrong with the Nike Lunarglide range as they are reasonably cheap and provide a lot of support if you’re overweight. I started off running with the Nike Lunarglide 2 shoes and they lasted for around 3 months of marathon training (approximately 500 miles). I then replaced the shoes 1 month before the marathon itself with the exact same pair of shoes. I reckon my original Lunarglide running shoes could have lasted another 100 miles, it’s just that I was paranoid at the time that they’d cut my feet up. Don’t Pay Any Attention To Those Who Laugh At Fat People Running If they understood how much it hurts, then they’d hesitate to mock those runners who run every day overweight. The idiots out there want to discourage you because they are jealous of your gall and ambition. Plus they are semi-retarded. Running can be difficult enough when you’re just starting off and when others mock you, it makes it twice as difficult. I think this picture says it all. Basically, fuck the haters. Can Being Overweight Cause Headaches Whilst Running? I can only speak for myself here but after a number of my long runs I experienced a migraine afterwards. Concerned about why this was happening, I went to my doctor and he told me I was trying too much too soon and that I should try to lose some weight through walking before progressing with training. Unfazed, I just slowed down in training and the migraines disappeared just like that. If you experience a headache out running as an overweight person, it could be your body’s way of telling you that you’re overexerting yourself. Slow down and consult your doctor for advice if the headaches persist. Training For A Marathon As An Overweight Person With retrospect I think that training for a marathon as a first race isn’t a great idea. Rather, it’s better to start with a 5k work up your way through the 10k to a half marathon and then tackle a marathon. My first race was the Larne Half Marathon 2011 in preparation for the Belfast City Marathon 2011. Since I hadn’t run in an event before I had no idea what lay ahead of me and as it came to the last few miles I was beginning to doubt my sanity for entering the race. That’s not to say that you’ll have a negative experience in the marathon if you’re overweight. My advice would be to work on building up your mileage to a consistent base of 40 miles per week by the time you’re half way through training and to keep at that level. First time around I was barely hitting 30 miles per week. This was obviously not enough. At such a low level of weekly mileage my long slow runs were absolute hell. Being Overweight On The Long Slow Run The long slow run was the training session I hated most when I was overweight. My normal pace at the time was a 10:00 min/mile and since i was greatly inexperienced I tried all of my long runs at the same space. This lead to complete mental and physical capitulation at the latter stage of my runs. Now I’ve learned that it’s more important to cover the distance at any speed as an overweight beginner. If you’re new to running a marathon then you won’t know what will hit you in that last 10K. That’s why it’s crucial to put in the distance regardless of your target time in the marathon. I would have fared better in the marathon if I’d eaten healthier. I was only 5lbs overweight by the time it came to race-day but that made all the difference. Marathon training provides an ideal opportunity to lose weight but only if you’re willing to eat sensibly. That’s why I think it’s OK to enter marathon training overweight, as long as you take proactive steps to reducing your mass by marathon time. As An Overweight Runner You Should Not Be Getting Out Of Breath Too Often. The biggest mistake overweight beginners make is to go out too fast. It’s common to hear of runners complaining about imminent heart failure or not being able to breathe properly. If this sounds like you, then you need to slow down. Whenever you go out for a run you should be able to hold a conversation with the person next to you. If this means running a 13 or a 15 minute mile then so be it. Once you become experienced at running a certain distance, then you can improve your speed. If you want to improve your speed whilst still overweight, an idea is to incorporate sprinting bursts towards the end of your workout. Make sure that you’ve got enough energy left though otherwise you might have to stop!. Is Running A Great Way To Lose Weight For Overweight People? Yes it is, but that does mean that you can’t monitor your diet. The biggest obstacle to losing weight running is failing to continue your appetite that comes from running more often. You can quite quickly undo all of your hard work by letting your diet slip. If you’re new to calorie counting then I recommend joining My Fitness Pal. They offer a range of excellent tools for monitoring your caloric intake. As An Overweight Person Can I Hurt Myself If I Run? If you haven’t ran before and try to start off running too fast or too often, then you run the risk of injury. That is why it’s important to start any running program slowly. In the early stages of your running life, it is best to start slowly and cover longer distances rather than running for shorter distances at a higher intensity. Once you get back to a healthy weight, you can then start workouts at a higher intensity. In my 16 months as a distance runner I’ve managed to avoid any serious injuries by just listening to my body. Remember, you know your body better than anyone. If your body is still aching after a run a day later then don’t run on it again. How To Improve Your Endurance And Motivation As An Overweight Runner. The key is to train as much as your body will allow you and making yourself accountable for training. New pedometer devices like the Fit Bit Ultra are excellent for this as you give you an insight into your daily exercise trends. You can see how far you’ve ran on a daily basis and can establish long term goals based upon your stats. You can even share your results with friends online. As a general rule, the longer you stay on your feet jogging, the better the results will be over time.i’ve found that the more I improve as runner, the easier it is to find motivation to go outside. If you think back to the first time you tried running it was probably a horrible experience. You were out of breath, exhausted and aching all over. Well as I progressed I’ve found that all the negative aspects of jogging dissipate and I’m left only with the positives. I Am 25lb/50lb/100lb Overweight. Am I Too Fat To Start Running? No, but if you’re overweight it is best to consult your doctor before starting a running program. When I was 75lbs overweight I felt like running was an impossibility. I started to feel hopeless that I would never be able to sustain an exercise program and control my weight in the future. Things started getting better when I realised that I could start running if I lost a little bit of weight and improved my diet. The important thing is to not lose hope if you perceive yourself to be fat. People do come back from obesity and become lifelong runners. The only person holding you back is yourself. Ignore what everyone else is doing exercise wise and focus on achieving your own goals. If I can do it, so can you. Just take it easy to begin with, enjoy what you’re doing and the rest will follow. I’ve Always Been Overweight, Even When I Was Still At School. Can I Still Run? Yep you can. I always hated gym lessons. It was 4 hours a week of pure physical torture. The problem was that the teachers were allocated so little time per week for fitness lessons that they had to work you hard to try to keep you fit in such a short period of time. This intensive approach left me feeling for a long time that I was not cut out for running or any type of fitness. How wrong was I? The key to enjoying running as a fat person is to run at your own pace and to focus on improving your own times and distances, rather than comparing yourself to the field. When you’re in school, running is all about competition. If you’re at the back then you’re a nothing. This simply isn’t true especially when you start running for your own reasons. Should I Factor In My BMI When It Comes To Running? No. You should only care about how you feel when you run. BMI is nothing but a vague number. If you try running and can’t continue without great discomfort, then you need to slow down, even to a walk. You will quickly get a feel for what you are capable of by testing your body over a period of time. When I was 270lbs I could run for maybe 0.1 mile at best. I’d be doubled over in pain from it too. This meant that I had to spend my first few months walking before I could introduce some running into my regime. My BMI was never a factor in this. My physical fitness was the only factor that kept me from running. If you think your BMI is too high for running, try jogging for a little bit and see how it feels. You might be surprised by how long you can last. If you can run for even 0.1 mile, over time you can build that up to 0.25, 0.5 and eventually a mile. It’s how I started and I’m now regularly running 40 miles per week.\n",

We agree, but preparation is everything and the simpler the plan, the better the plan. Image by Amy Ebedes The half marathon is the most popular distance in South Africa because it’s long enough to test even the most hardened ultra runner, but short enough for anyone to achieve. It’s also a great way to see if you’ve got the metal to run a marathon and beyond – no matter how long the Two Oceans and Comrades are, running a half is certainly a significant athletic achievement. Also add in that the training is manageable compared to marathons and ultras, and you recover quicker. Whether you choose to run a half or a f ull marathon depends partly on time and commitment: How much time do you have to train? Marathon training programmes usually last from 12 to 18 weeks, with numerous long runs scattered throughout. In contrast, our half marathon training programme takes only eight weeks, and it will get you to the finish line as well as ensure that you make it to the starting line healthy and ready to do your best. RELATED: Transitioning From The Half To Full Marathon Not only will you need to invest less training time while preparing for a half marathon than a marathon, your injury risk will be lower. Plus, you won’t need to worry about all those super-long runs on weekends, and there will certainly be less to worry about on race day. Many marathon veterans appreciate that half marathon training requires lower mileage, which means they can run those kays at a faster pace than they would for the marathon. RELATED: Half Marathon, Full Life!Get Started Below you’ll find two different half marathon training programmes, each 8 weeks long. One is for novices and the other for slightly more advanced runners. Choose the one that suits your needs best and go for it.

I’m not fond of programs that include specific tempo/speedwork/fartleks because I run with music and judge my runs by distance and approximate time. I can’t always measure out 400m or 800m and I prefer to pick a fast song and do “speed work” or tempo work and then choose and easy song for the easy runs – managed to get from 5km to 10km injury free and was bags of fun!Replyowen says:20th December 2012 at 12:15 pmthank you for this, i will use the novice program for my preparation for feb.17, 2013 18K race. i’m a cyclist and this will be my first run/race Reply Claire says:22nd December 2012 at 9:56 am On both programmes what are you classifying as the ‘easy’ runs – is it those in a lighter colour at the start of the week?

This program looks so straightforward I can’t wait to try it!Reply Adri says:17th November 2014 at 11:10 amhi, I am not sure of this program. I mean, it is for beginners. How can a couch potato run a 7 km in his/her first week? Even if you walk the distance, it is too far. And to start with a 4km on day 1? Come on guys, usually one has to start with walking and the second week alternate it with slow running for a few minutes. I don’t think a beginner will be able to manage this. It is too much too quick. The chances of injuries are also much higher. Give us a programme that starts with walking for at least 2 weeks. Reply Runners World says:18th November 2014 at 12:24 pm Hi Adri, We certainly don’t expect absolute beginners to use this programme. We recommend beginners follow these steps ( http://www.runnersworld.co.za/training/the-starting-line/) and get a solid running base before embarking on a half marathon training programme. Please shout if we can provide any further assistance. Reply Duduzile says:18th November 2014 at 3:59 pm I have just downloaded this, I will start my training today afternoon. It looks so interesting Reply Marek says:25th February 2015 at 11:08 pm I agree that an 8 week training plan is possible, however, I would imagine that someone who wants to run a half marathon in such a short time, would at least be able to run 2-3 miles by now. If starting from scratch and wanting to run a half in 8 weeks, I think there maybe not enough time to fully enjoy it. I’ve simplified the 8 week training program here: http://helpgetfit.com/train-half-marathon-8-weeks Most important, make sure to enjoy yourself and you will keep running after the event!Replymandla says:1st March 2015 at 7:33 pm Hi l need a program for 21km training I’m a registered runner my first 21km l ran 1hour 21 mins only join running last year but l need some training tips Reply Rua says:5th May 2015 at 11:34 pm Hi Runners World.

            "Text: Monday, May 13, 2013 by Jeff Sanders How to Train for Your First Half Marathonby Jeff Sanders — Get free updates of new posts here. The half marathon is the most popular distance for a reason – it`s a good challenge while also being MUCH easier than a full marathon. Photo Credit: Jeff Sanders Between training runs and official races, I have run a half marathon distance more than 50 times. The 13.1-miles was daunting at first, but it quickly became my favorite distance. Here's how to train for your first half marathon. Why a Half Marathon? To the average person, running 13 miles sounds crazy. It takes about two hours on average to finish if you are in good shape and you could spend months preparing for your first race. Here's the good news: half marathons are not that hard. In fact, they are considerably easier than a full marathon at 26.2 miles. If I had to guess, I would say that the full marathon is about 4 times harder than the half. For some reason, once you hit “the wall” around mile 20, your body turns into a war zone and it takes real strength to push to the finish. Thankfully, it is highly unlikely you will hit the wall if you train well for the half marathon. How to Get Started I was not a good runner when I started. In fact, I was overweight, drinking like a sailor, and couldn't run one mile without stopping for a much-needed break. Keep that in mind as you overcome your own set of excuses. It doesn't matter how busy you are, how slow you run, or if you can even run at all. Running is a learned skill – not a natural talent. Acknowledge where you are. The biggest mistake you can make in the beginning is over-estimating your abilities, which only leads to injuries and giving up the goal altogether. Go out for a really easy run today. Don't wait. The excuses are already building as you read this sentence. To increase the momentum, you need to get started – now. Create an achievable weekly goal. Get out your calendar and find 3 blocks of time each week when you can run. I recommend running in the morningbecause you are more likely to succeed early in the day. Run short distances with plenty of walk breaks. The real key to training for a long distance run is to make running easy and fun. Do what it takes to maintain your love for running as you train. If you hate training, what are the odds you will one day cross the finish line? Variety is key. Run on the roads, trails, treadmills, and in your living room. Don't forget yoga, strength training, and volleyball. Cross-training is great to make you a better overall athlete and a better runner. Start to think of yourself as a runner. Ask yourself, would a marathon runner go out for a run in the rain, or the snow, or at 4 am? Answer: yes. Yes, runners just run. The weather only affects what you wear, not whether or not your will run. Slowly increase your long runs. Pick one day a week when you will do a long run. I like Saturday mornings. Start with a long run around 3 miles and then slowly increase that distance each week. For example, the first week could be 3.0 miles, second week 3.5 miles, third week 4.0 miles, etc. Here's my anti-advice. I'm not going to tell you to do what most runners and trainers will advise, which is to sign up for a race and then set a training schedule to hit that target date. On the contrary, you should train consistentlyand easily, eat a healthy diet with lot's of fruit, and build your strength slowly over time. Then, when your body is ready, sign up for a race that is coming up soon. I use a Heart Rate Training system as outlined in a great book called Heart Rate Training. I highly recommend this system as a slow and effective method to become a great runner. How Fast Should I Run 13.1 Miles? As a point of reference, the St. Louis Half Marathon (pictured above) was my fastest half marathon to date. I finished that race in 1 hour and 44 minutes. I don't run for speed. It's rare for me to try to beat someone else on a race course because I don't run to win. I run for fun. Your finish time will depend on many factors, but the average finish time is around two hours. The elite Olympians finish in about one hour while the slowest runners normally stroll in around four hours. You will quickly be able to calculate your approximate finish time as you train. For example, an average of 9-minutes per mile will result in a finish time of 1 hour and 58 minutes. How long will this process take? It's hard to give a definite time frame because there are many variables to consider (your running experience, current level of ability, schedule, determination, etc.). However, assuming you are starting from scratch – meaning you are somewhat overweight with a mediocre diet and running is a foreign language – this could take anywhere from 3-6 months. I recommend 6-12 months. Slower really is better. I can't tell you how many times I have injured myself because I pushed myself too hard, too fast. Don't do that to yourself. Your heart and lungs will adjust quickly to running, but your ligaments, tendons, and joints will adapt over a much longer period of time. As another point of reference, if you finish a run and you are severely out of breath – you ran too hard. If your heart is pounding through your chest – you ran too hard. If you finish a training run and you are NOT smiling – you ran too hard!Run slow, run easy, and run for fun!Your First Step Go out for an easy run or fast walk today. The best first step to prepare for running is to move your body. That may seem obvious, but many people ask me running advice before they have even run a single mile. Start small and let the momentum build. Resources Here a few other posts I have written about running that could be helpful.
