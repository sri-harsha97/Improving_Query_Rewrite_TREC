      "Turn 1: I just had a breast biopsy for cancer. What are the most common types?\n",
      "System Response: More research is needed. Types Breast cancer can be: Ductal carcinoma: This begins in the milk duct and is the most common type. Lobular carcinoma: This starts in the lobules. Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue, increasing the chance of spreading to other parts of the body. Non-invasive breast cancer is when the cancer is still inside its place of origin and has not broken out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 2: Once it breaks out, how likely is it to spread?\n",
      "System Response: Even though this condition doesn’t spread, it’s important to keep an eye on it. Between 20% to 40% of women with this condition will develop a separate invasive breast cancer -- one that will grow outside its original location -- within the next 15 years. Most of the time, these later cancers begin in the milk ducts, rather than the lobules. How is lobular carcinoma in situ diagnosed? You often won’t have any symptoms with LCIS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 3: How deadly is it?\n",
      "System Response: In 1999, a student opened fire at W. R. Myers, killing one student and seriously wounding another. In 2000, LCI was locked down after two youths were arrested and two firearms were seized. Section::::Campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 4: What? No, I want to know about the deadliness of lobular carcinoma in situ.\n",
      "System Response: It’s sometimes difficult to separate the two conditions and in this case it will be described as lobular neoplasia. Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 5: Wow, that's better than I thought.  What are common treatments?\n",
      "System Response: Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 6: How does it behave differently from PLCIS?\n",
      "System Response: Wilson said she has “vigilantly monitored” her health with mammograms and MRIs after knowing she had an “underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ).” When a recent breast biopsy revealed PLCIS (pleomorphic carcinoma in situ), initial tests showed that it was not cancerous. But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection. Last week, Taylor Swift revealed that her mother had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and urged her fans to remind their parents about getting screened.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 7: What makes lobular cancer distinct?\n",
      "System Response: Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 8: For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery?\n",
      "System Response: Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu. These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents. Overall, the 5-year survival rate of invasive ductal carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003. Section::::Treatment. Treatment of invasive carcinoma of no special type (NST) depends on the size of the mass (size of the\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 9: No, I meant for lobular.\n",
      "System Response: The breast cancer has been detected in the early stages and can be very effectively treated. Stage 1 can be divided into Stage 1A and Stage 1B. The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller). Similar to stage 0, breast cancer at this stage is very treatable and survivable. When breast cancer is detected early, and is in the localized stage, the 5-year relative survival rate is 100%.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn 10: Does freezing work?\n",
      "System Response: Cryoablation is another local treatment for single, small metastatic breast cancer tumors, especially in women who aren't good surgery candidates. Guided by imaging (ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI), cryoablation inserts a special freezing probe (a type of catheter) through the skin and to the tumor to be treated. Once the tip of the probe is in the right spot inside the tumor core, pressurized argon gas is injected through the probe into the tumor, freezing and destroying the cancerous tissue. Cryoablation techniques may vary from one cancer treatment facility to another. Cryoablation is more common in cases where the breast cancer is being well controlled by systemic treatments.\n",

      "Turn Context: How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA. Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases?\n"

This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases. ||| For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery?\n",

Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about. ||| Wow, that's better than I thought.  What are common treatments? ||| Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy. ||| How does it behave differently from PLCIS? ||| Wilson said she has “vigilantly monitored” her health with mammograms and MRIs after knowing she had an “underlying condition of LCIS, (lobular carcinoma in situ).” When a recent breast biopsy revealed PLCIS (pleomorphic carcinoma in situ), initial tests showed that it was not cancerous. But Wilson had second thoughts. “A friend who had had breast cancer suggested I get a second opinion on my pathology and my gut told me that was the thing to do,” she wrote. When she went to two other pathologists, both confirmed a cancer diagnosis. “I share this to educate others that a second opinion is critical to your health,” she said. “You have nothing to lose if both opinions match up for the good, and everything to gain if something that was missed is found, which does happen. Early diagnosis is key.” Wilson is the second celebrity in a week to do a public service announcement for early cancer detection. Last week, Taylor Swift revealed that her mother had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and urged her fans to remind their parents about getting screened. ||| What makes lobular cancer distinct? ||| Invasive lobuluar cancer is a less common type of breast cancer than invasive ductal cancer. This cancer accounts for about 10% of all invasive breast cancer cases. Prognosis for infiltrating and invasive lobular breast carcinomas will naturally be influenced by tumor size, grade, stage and hormone receptor status.. However, lobular breast cancers, when positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, tend to respond very well to hormone therapy. The overall breast cancer survival rates for infiltrating lobular carcinoma, when matched by stage, are a little higher than for ductal carcinoma for the first 5 years. Survival rates range from about 77% to 93%, but on average the 5 year survival rate was estimated at about 90%. How old are these figures, Doc? The general range of survival 77% to 93% is over 10 years old so expect higher now. The average survival rate of 90% was as of 2010, so still quite old. Infiltrating/Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)Infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the generic type (NOS) is by far the most common breast cancer type, and represents about 78% of all cases. ||| For the first stage, what are the alternatives to surgery? ||| Regardless of the histological subtype, the prognosis of IDC depends also on tumor size, presence of cancer in the lymph nodes, histological grade, presence of cancer in small vessels (vascular invasion), expression of hormone receptors and of oncogenes like HER2/neu. These parameters can be entered into models that provide a statistical probability of systemic spread. The probability of systemic spread is a key factor in determining whether radiation and chemotherapy are worthwhile. The individual parameters are important also because they can predict how well a cancer will respond to specific chemotherapy agents. Overall, the 5-year survival rate of invasive ductal carcinoma was approximately 85% in 2003. Section::::Treatment.

Types Breast cancer can be: Ductal carcinoma: This begins in the milk duct and is the most common type. Lobular carcinoma: This starts in the lobules. Invasive breast cancer is when the cancer cells break out from inside the lobules or ducts and invade nearby tissue, increasing the chance of spreading to other parts of the body.

Stage 1 can be divided into Stage 1A and Stage 1B. The difference is determined by the size of the tumor and the lymph nodes with evidence of cancer. Stage 1A breast cancer means the following description applies: The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller) AND has not spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 1B breast cancer means one of the following descriptions applies: Lymph nodes have cancer evidence with small clusters of cells between the approximate size of a pinprick to the approximate width of a grain of rice (.2mm to 2.0 mm). AND EITHER No actual tumor is found in the breast. OR The tumor is smaller than the approximate size of a peanut (2 centimeters or smaller). Similar to stage 0, breast cancer at this stage is very treatable and survivable. When breast cancer is detected early, and is in the localized stage, the 5-year relative survival rate is 100%. ||| Does freezing work?\n",

Agriculture is seen to be one of the main players in the depletion of soil richness in human history. Certain agricultural practices can deplete soil of carbon, such as monoculture, failing to rotate crops sufficiently, and intensive livestock grazing.

Theories explaining why this behavior becomes active during this time suggest that early weaning and stress as a consequence of separation from the mother and litter-mates and exposure to a new environment are to blame. ||| Will it kill him? ||| This stress can be passed on to puppies and kittens affecting their disposition, personality and behavior. Premature weaning stresses the developing immune system. Moreover, the time they spend away from their mother while in the puppy mill, subjected to the same stressful living conditions, is highly stressful. But that’s not the end of their stress. Shipping to pet stores puts them through a great deal of stress. ||| What?  No.  Will eating plastic kill my cat? ||| Any object may be a potential target, however. Why is Pica Dangerous? Other than its destructive potential, pica can be extremely hazardous to your cat's health if non-food items are consumed. Ingested fabric, string, or other materials can lodge in your cat's stomach or intestine. The blockage prevents the passage of food and may cut off the blood supply to these organs. Both are life-threatening conditions. Cat's that chew on power cords may be electrocuted. Additionally, many common houseplants are toxic to cats; chewing or eating these plants can cause a wide range of symptoms from drooling to death. If your cat has a history of ingesting non-food items and becomes lethargic, vomits, or displays other concerning behavior, take them to your veterinarian immediately. Why Does My Cat Eat/Chew on Non-food Items? No one knows exactly why some cats exhibit pica behavior. Because pica has been associated with a variety of diseases including feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency virus, a veterinarian should examine any cat with pica. ||| How do I get him to stop? ||| If there has been a change in your life recently — moving to a different house, a new schedule, new roommate, outdoor construction — your cat might be acting out because of anxiety. Begin by addressing the cause of the stress (do a web search for \"\"stressed cat\"\" and you’ll find lots of advice on how to do that) and spending time with your cat to help her adapt. Ease the Boredom Feline pica is also pretty common in bored or lonely cats. You can ease a cat’s boredom by providing environmental enrichment. Give him puzzle toys including things such as rolling treat balls to keep him busy while you’re away at work. ||| Should I get a second one? ||| \"Introducing a Second Cat or Pet Before bringing a new pet into your heart and home, ask yourself, \"\"Why do I want another pet?\"\" Two pets are not necessarily just as easy or just as much work as one. Another pet will require time, energy, expense and patience. Many people who do not have enough time for one pet think that two will be better because they will keep each other company. If you think a second pet will help alleviate loneliness, boredom or behavior problems with your resident pet, think again. If you don't have time to spend with one cat, you surely will not have time to spend with two. Many cat owners end up with two bored and misbehaving pets instead of one. Furthermore, a second pet will not necessarily provide your cat with the companionship you have in mind. If you are willing to put in the time, patience and expense of a second pet, then take a look at your cat's desires. ||| What are his desires?\n",

      "Why do cats eat plastic? ||| \"The persistence of pica in the seeming absence of a physiological cause might be due to the fortuitous acquisition of a conditioned illness during the period of physiological insult.\" Cats also display pica behavior in their natural environments and there is evidence to support that this behavior has a psychological aspect to it. Some breeds (such as the Siamese cat) are more predisposed to showing this type of behavior than other breeds, but several types of breeds have been documented to show pica.

Provide old cardboard boxes around the house with a few toys inside for added fun. Catnip - Many cats love catnip, it relaxes them and they seem to really go crazy for it. Toys can be bought with catnip inside or you could even provide your indoor cat with their own little tray of fresh growing catnip for them to chew on. Cat videos - Many cats like the sound of human voices being around during the day, it may help them to feel secure.

Why? ||| Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (\"Avena spp.\") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA).

In most parts of the world, it is the primary [ 1] animal milk consumed by humans, although goat, sheep, and even camel milk are popular based on the availability of animals. Cow milk (derived from bovines) is intended for sucking by young cows, just as human infants are often nursed with human breast milk. However, the nutritional value and availability of cow’s milk have made it one of the most in-demand liquids on the planet. More than 6 billion people on the planet drink milk on a semi-regular basis, which means that these animals are an incredibly important part of our global nutritional needs. ||| What about an alternative. I’ve heard it's also made from almonds? ||| Commercially available almond milk is often enriched with vitamins A and D, as well as calcium, to make it seem more like regular milk. (Almonds provide some calcium, but not as much as cow’s milk.) Almond milk is low in calories compared to other milk substitutes and contains some heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Be sure to check the labels of almond milk before you buy, because some brands contain preservatives, and other additives. Note that you can make almond milk at home – an easy process, requiring only organic raw almonds, water and a little sugar or other sweetener. You can find many recipes online. You might also try oat, hemp or rice milk. Oat milk provides more fiber than other milk substitutes and was shown in a Swedish study to help lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and total cholesterol. Hemp milk, made by pulverizing the seeds, blending them with water and straining out the solid residue, provides both omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids in a healthy three-to-one ratio. Utterance type: Question ||| Which is healthiest? ||| Why Whole Milk is the Healthiest Choicetweet email 227By: Experience Life August 31, 2009About Experience Life Follow Experience Life at @ Experience Life I drink whole milk and eat full-fat yogurt, cream cheese, and sour cream. Sure, full-fat dairy products taste better than the skim/fat-free versions, but I don’t eat them for the taste. I eat full-fat dairy because it’s better for my health and my weight. Yep, you heard me right: I eat dairy products with all the fat god gave ‘em, and I do it because it’s good for me. Here’s why:1. Our bodies cannot digest the protein or absorb the calcium from milk without the fat. Love This? Never Miss Another Story.2. Vitamins A and D are also fat-soluble. So you can’t absorb them from milk when all the fat has been skimmed off. (This makes fortified skim milk the biggest sham of all — you can pump fat-free milk full of a year’s supply of vitamins A and D, but the body can’t access them).3. ||| No, the vegan ones. Which of those alternatives is healthiest? ||| There are a ton of nondairy milks to choose from, but which one is the healthiest?»RELATED: Milk in the fridge? Someone may owe you money To find out, researchers from Mc Gill University recently conducted an experiment, published in the Journal of Food Science and Technology, to determine the nutritional value of plant-based milk beverages. To do so, they compared the health benefits of the four most popular alternative milks, including soy, almond, coconut and rice. They examined the number of calories and amount of protein, fat and carbohydrates found in each. They also looked into the vitamins and minerals the substitutes contained. While they said cow’s milk still has the most nutritional value, with 8 grams of protein, 9 grams of fat and 11.5 grams of carbs, soy is the most comparable for overall balance. It’s “a clear winner,” they wrote in a statement. It has more protein than all the other milk options analyzed, with 7 to 12 grams and 95 calories a glass. ||| Can I make it at home? ||| Soy milk maker A soy milk maker is a small kitchen appliance which automatically cooks soy milk, a non-dairy beverage made from soy beans. Soy milk makers work similarly to a combination between a home blender and an automatic coffee maker. Some soy milk makers can also be programmed to make almond milk, rice milk, and other vegetable-based steeped beverages. Homemade soy milk can be made to the drinkers' tastes and nutritional requirements, providing added value. Soy pulp, a by-product of soy milk preparation, can be used as an ingredient in many recipes and food products. Ordinary methods for making soy milk at home are often very labor-intensive (requiring beans to be soaked, ground in a blender, strained, and then cooked). Soy milk machines perform many of these steps automatically, greatly simplifying home-based soy milk production. Section::::Standard operation. Before use, dried beans are rinsed with water to remove particulate debris, soaked for 6–10 hours to moisten and soften the dried beans, and then rinsed again before use. ||| Oat seems popular now.  Why? ||| Oat milk Oat milk is a type of plant milk derived from whole oat (\"Avena spp.\") grains by soaking the plant material to extract its nutrients. Oat milk naturally has a creamy texture and a characteristically oatmeal-like flavor, though it is sold commercially in various flavor-varieties such as sweetened, unsweetened, vanilla, and chocolate. Unlike other plant milks, whose origins date as early as the 13th century, oat milk is a modern creation, developed by the Swedish scientist Rickard Oste in the early 1990s. Oats contain high amounts of functional protein, dietary fiber (β-glucan), and unsaturated fatty acids, which make oat milk a significant source of nutrients, though uncertainty surrounds its practical use as a dairy milk substitute. Regardless, oat milk is often consumed to replace dairy milk in vegan diets, or in the cases of medical conditions where dairy is incompatible, such as lactose intolerance or a cow's milk allergy (CMA). Section::::History. Section::::History.:Creation. Soy milk predates all other alternative milks, including oat milk, both as a cultural and commercial product. ||| I’m going to bake some cookies. Which one would be the best to use? ||| One cup of soy milk provides 4 grams of unsaturated fat, 1 gram of fiber, and 7 grams of protein. Soymilk has 75% more antioxidants than cow’s milk. It is hearty, rich and creamy. Soy milk is good for drinking straight from the glass, poured over cereal or in coffee. The taste is nutty and slightly sweet. When it comes to cooking, soy milk is one of the best milks to choose. It can be used in place of cow’s milk in any recipe. It is stable at high temperatures which makes it a good choice for savory dishes and sauces. In baking, soy milk is also one of the best choices because of its high protein content. According to veganbaking.net curdling milk with an acid such as vinegar creates complex flavors and thickens the mixture. This in turn “increases leavening power and enhances the crumb quality of cakes and muffins.” Since curdling is dependent on protein content, soy milk does the best job. That means that soy milk is also the best choice when making vegan buttermilk for Vegan Buttermilk Biscuits or for dredging to make breaded dishes like “Chicken-Fried” Tofu Steaks. ||| What would be second best?\n",

The result resembles milk in color, texture, and flavor. Hemp is conducive to being organically grown and labeled. Plain hemp milk may be additionally sweetened or flavored. Section::::Production. Production of hemp milk requires hemp seeds, water, and a blender. Many recipes call for ground vanilla or vanilla extract to add flavor, and a type of sweetener. Once all the ingredients are blended together, some people pour the hemp milk through a cheesecloth and strainer to get a smoother and more refined milky texture, but this process is optional. Section::::Use in coffee. Compared to soy milk, in coffee culture, hemp milk is said to produce better latte art and to have a texture more like cow's milk. Section::::Nutrition. In a serving, hemp milk provides 46 calories from 3 g of carbohydrates, 3 g of fat and 2 g of protein. Hemp milk contains no micronutrients in significant amounts. ||| I didn’t expect that.

History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. ||| What were Ziegler’s improvements?\n",

He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying \"It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?\". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983.

      "What’s the history of steroid use in sports in the US? ||| Over the years, the popularity of steroids has varied, but in 2001, it was found that about 2% of high school students used steroids in the past year. History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. ||| What were Ziegler’s improvements? ||| John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (\"ca.\" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying \"It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?\". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983. Section::::Biography. Section::::Biography.:Early life. Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. ||| Why are they banned? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory. Following this event, the US Congress decided to place anabolic steroids under the list of Controlled Substances. Within no time, the drug was included among the other drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. ||| Are there visible signs?\n",

Even with this subterfuge, WADA found that Russia had the highest number of athletes who were caught doping in 2014. Rodchenkov blamed that on athletes who took drugs that he had not approved. — At the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov spearheaded a clandestine, late-night effort to swap out Russian athletes’ dirty urine with clean urine provided months earlier, before the athletes began doping. With the assistance of Russian intelligence officers — who, the Times alleges, were able to develop a replacement for the tamper-proof caps used on the specimen bottles —  Rodchenkov would exchange dirty urine samples with athletes’ clean samples provided by a colleague, who was stationed in what nominally was a storage closet next door.

In an e-mail sent to the Denver Post, Welker seemingly takes aim at the league’s drug-testing policy. The league is only saying that Welker tested positive for amphetamine. A source told the Denver Post’s Mike Klis that the amphetamine in question was adderall, not MDMA (aka Molly) as was speculated by some on Tuesday. As Deadspin points out, MDMA is indeed an amphetamine, but it falls under the league’s recreational-drug policy, not its performance-enhancing drug policy, so it’s seemingly not the drug in question here. Last September, the Denver Post wrote about how the NFL deals with adderall, a commonly prescribed drug that treats attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but one that also causes feelings of exhilaration, increased energy and mental alertness when used in a non-prescribed manner. It is classified as a performance-enhancing drug and a drug of abuse by the NFL. ||| What is the difference between the two policies?\n",

      "What’s the history of steroid use in sports in the US? ||| Over the years, the popularity of steroids has varied, but in 2001, it was found that about 2% of high school students used steroids in the past year. History The history of anabolic steroids can be traced back to as early as 1930's, before the term steroid was even used. In the 1930's, a team of scientists was able to create a synthetic form of testosterone (a male hormone) to help treat men who were unable to produce enough of the hormone for normal growth, development, and sexual functioning. Later, during World War II it was found that this artificial form of testosterone could be used to help malnourished soldiers gain weight and improve performance. After the war, athletes began to use steroids to enhance their performance in competitions. In the 1956 Olympics, Soviet athletes, especially wrestlers, performed at exceptionally high levels. After learning that those athletes were using testosterone, an American physician (Dr. Zeigler) created a more selective form of what we know as anabolic steroids. ||| What were Ziegler’s improvements? ||| John Bosley Ziegler John Bosley Ziegler (\"ca.\" 1920–1983) — known as John Ziegler and Montana Jack — was the American physician who originally developed the anabolic steroid Methandrostenolone (Dianabol, DBOL) which was released in the USA in 1958 by Ciba. He pioneered its athletic use as an aid to muscle growth by bodybuilders, administering it to U.S. weightlifting champion Bill March of the York Barbell club in 1959 when he was the physician to the U.S. Weightlifting team. It was banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Controlled Substances Act. In later life he was outspoken against its use in sport, saying \"It is bad enough to have to deal with drug addicts, but now healthy athletes are putting themselves in the same category. It's a disgrace. Who plays sports for fun anymore?\". Ziegler suffered from heart disease, which he partially ascribed to his experimentation with steroids, and he died from heart failure in 1983. Section::::Biography. Section::::Biography.:Early life. Ziegler was born in the Midwestern United States but he returned to his family roots in southern Pennsylvania and graduated from Gettysburg College in 1942. ||| Why are they banned? ||| The excessive use of steroids by athletes to further improve their athletic capabilities has indeed caught the attention of many people all around the entire world. With this attention, a few controversies arose, and these controversies lead to steroids being banned in some countries all over the world. One of the main arguments against the use of steroids is the idea of them being unfair when it comes to other athletes who do not use it. Besides this, there are also issues regarding the negative effects that it has on the body as well as some unfortunate crime of violence that was also attributed to the use of the drug. When Was it Banned in the US? Everything started after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul where the sprinter and steroid user Ben Johnson achieved his controversial victory. Following this event, the US Congress decided to place anabolic steroids under the list of Controlled Substances. Within no time, the drug was included among the other drugs under the Controlled Substances Act. ||| Are there visible signs? ||| Warning Signs Of Steroid Use The possible red flags of anabolic steroid use include: Increased acne and facial bloating Enlarged breasts in boys or smaller breasts in girls Persistent bad breath Skin eruptions and infections Increased aggression or irritability Hair loss in bed, shower, comb, or brush Small red or purplish acne Depression, hallucinations, extreme feelings of mistrust or fear Drastic appetite shifts Loss or gain of interest in friends and decline in grades Unexplained presence or recovery of needles, vials, alcohol swabs, rubber tops and stoppers, syringes, amp openers, sterile injectable oils, waters, or vitamins Phone conversations becoming more private Changes in body build, including development of the upper body, muscle growth, and rapid weight gain Behavioral, emotional, or psychological changes Needle marks in the buttocks or thighs Effects On Mind Many studies have suggested that testosterone and anabolic steroids affect the functioning of the central nervous system (CNS). It has also been revealed that many people who administer excessively high doses of anabolic steroids tend to experience mood, sexuality, and aggression changes during or after the use of these drugs, though these effects may be rapid or involve long-term modifications at the genomic level. ||| That sounds easy to spot.  How do they get away with it? ||| Rodchenkov combined three steroids and dissolved that mixture into liquor — Chivas whiskey for men, Martini vermouth for women — in order to speed up absorption and shorten the detection window. “The athletes were instructed to swish the liquid around in their mouths, under the tongue, to absorb the drugs,” the Times writes. Even with this subterfuge, WADA found that Russia had the highest number of athletes who were caught doping in 2014. Rodchenkov blamed that on athletes who took drugs that he had not approved. — At the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov spearheaded a clandestine, late-night effort to swap out Russian athletes’ dirty urine with clean urine provided months earlier, before the athletes began doping. With the assistance of Russian intelligence officers — who, the Times alleges, were able to develop a replacement for the tamper-proof caps used on the specimen bottles —  Rodchenkov would exchange dirty urine samples with athletes’ clean samples provided by a colleague, who was stationed in what nominally was a storage closet next door.

      "How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA. Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene.

Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome.

Chromosomal diseases can be also caused by segments and joins of parts of chromosomes. ||| You missed the second type of disease.  What was that? ||| A large genetic mistake typically occurs in the woman's egg, which may partially explain why older women are more likely to have babies with Down syndrome . Many chromosome errors cause the fetus to be aborted before birth, but some syndromes can be born and survive, though all typically suffer severe mental and physical defects. Down syndrome is the most common and well-known chromosome defect, but there are many. Types of chromosome diseases: There are several common types of chromosome errors that cause disease. The effects of errors in the sex chromosomes (X and Y) differ greatly from errors in the autosomes (chromosomes 1..22). ||| That’s not what I wanted. How about recent developments in gene therapy to treat those defects? ||| This is all happening with ­dizzying speed. CRISPR has spawned two contentious, parallel debates, with Doudna squarely in the middle of both. The first is the ethical issue raised by the mother of the child with Down syndrome: How far should we go in editing the human genome? The new technique potentially enables changes in the human “germline” cells, which could entail changes not only to a single person’s genome but also to that of any of the person’s descendants. Many ­researchers say they worry about unintended consequences with long-term effects. ||| What are they worried about? ||| With CRISPR, the California researchers added a set of genes conferring malaria resistance to their mutant mosquitoes, as well as a powerful tool called a “gene drive” that guarantees that all of the mosquitoes’ descendants would inherit their resistance. [Why we should all hope to get bitten by a GMO mosquito] “Gene drives” work by manipulating the laws of genetics so that the desired genes are copied onto both of an offspring’s chromosomes when a mutant mates with a wild mosquito. Ordinarily, offspring get just half their traits from each parent — but with the mutant inserting its DNA into both chromosomes, mosquitoes with the gene drive were able to pass on the resistance to 99.5 percent of their offspring, the researchers say. According to the New York Times, the gene drive has the potential to spread malaria resistance throughout a wild population in a matter of just 10 mosquito generations, or a single summer. Kevin Esvelt, an evolutionary engineer at Harvard University who studies the technique in yeast and wasn’t involved in the mosquito study, called the research a “major advance.” “This work suggests that we’re a hop, skip and jump away from actual gene drive candidates for eventual release,” he told the Associated Press, For now, the mutant mosquitoes are being kept in a highly secure lab behind a series of locked doors. ||| No, I meant in humans. ||| That could be for the better, but quite possibly for the worse, since the interrelated genetic functions developed over the long history of evolution remain unknown, despite the advances Baltimore notes. While the ethical and regulatory focus of concern has been on “designer babies” or threats to the human germline, the high risk of unintended consequences also applies to editing the genes of other life forms, from mice and mosquitos to microbes. Some of the top scientists, ethicists and legal experts in the field examine these issues in The WorldPost this week. “Recent leaps in the biosciences, combined with big data analysis, have led us to the cusp of a revolution in medicine,” writes Craig Venter, who led the team that first mapped the human genome and remains on the frontier of new breakthroughs. “Not only have we learned to read and write the genetic code; now we can put it in digital form and translate it back into synthesized life. ||| It sounds like it could be used in many places.

This has already been successfully used to target important genes in many cell lines and organisms, including human (34), bacteria (41), zebrafish (32), C. elegans (42), plants (34), Xenopus tropicalis (43), yeast (44), Drosophila (45), monkeys (46), rabbits (47), pigs (42), rats (48) and mice (49). Several groups have now taken advantage of this method to introduce single point mutations (deletions or insertions) in a particular target gene, via a single g RNA (14, 21, 29). Using a pair of g RNA-directed Cas9 nucleases instead, it is also possible to induce large deletions or genomic rearrangements, such as inversions or translocations (50). ||| I’ve heard a lot about RNA recently. Can it be used to edit that too? ||| Currently, off-target effects of CRISPRi are minimal, and show a reduced response and sensitivity to single-base mismatches. Importantly, when non-specific effects do inevitably occur they are reversible, time-dependent, and less damaging than DNA editing, making them effective alternatives that can limit the off-target burden when possible. CRISPR-cas13b, using a type IV CRISPR-Cas system (as opposed to the commonly used type II) can target and edit specific RNA sequences. Such an RNA editing platform has the ability to specifically edit mRNA, and therefore protein translation, without altering the DNA.

And How Can It Be Used to Turn Genes ‘Off’? June 13, 2016 | Matt Shipman CRISPR systems have been a hot research topic since they were shown to have utility as genetic engineering tools in 2012. And they’re often explained in a way that most folks can understand. But those explanations often overlook key details – like the fact that scientists are still in the process of discovering the fundamental rules of how these systems work. For example, here’s a simplified explanation: CRISPR-Cas systems protect bacteria from invaders such as viruses. They do this by creating small strands of RNA that match DNA sequences specific to a given invader. When those CRISPR RNAs find a match, they unleash Cas proteins that chop up the invader’s DNA, preventing it from replicating. But of course it’s more complex than that. For example, there are six different types of CRISPR systems (that we know of). One of the most widely-studied CRISPR systems is CRISPR-Cas9, which is a Type II CRISPR system. ||| That’s too basic, I’d like a more scientific explanation.\n",

      "How do genes work? ||| Genes A gene is a short piece of DNA. Genes tell the body how to build specific proteins. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works. A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype. Information Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your chromosomes. Chromosomes have matching pairs of 1 copy of a specific gene. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome. Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive: Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes. Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together. Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as sickle cell anemia, can be caused by a change in a single gene. ||| What other diseases are caused by a single change? ||| The four types of (human) Genetic diseases are:1) Single-gene/monogenic Genetic Diseases: In this category the starting point is a mutation/change in one gene. The next question is how a change in the sequence of a single gene can cause severe disorders. Genes code for proteins which are some of the most important tools for the living beings, and also take place in the structures of the cells. The results of a mutation that happens in a part of gene that codes for a functional part of a protein are unwelcome. The protein is no more functional and as a result, many severe consequences take place. Almost 6000 single gene disorders are known and it is estimated that 1 of 200 newborns face a single gene genetic disorder. Some of these are sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Aicardi Syndrome, Huntington’s disease. ||| What are the other types of diseases? ||| 3) Chromosomal Genetic Diseases: Chromosomes are big DNA molecules composed from genes. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus. Abnormalities in the structure, number (and not only) of the chromosomes can cause some of the most dangerous genetic disorders. This type of disorders seem to be much easier to observe because they are, sometimes, detected by examination with microscope.

Your physician interprets your ferritin test results and recommends improving your ferritin levels when tests indicate they are low. With some know-how and dietary changes, you can improve your iron intake so that your ferritin levels increase.1Consume a wide variety of iron-rich foods. Following a restrictive diet that omits many foods increases your risk of having low ferritin. There are two forms of iron – animal foods contain heme iron, while plants contain non-heme iron.

Your diet should consist of 10 to 35 percent calories from protein, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010. This means that if you are on a 2,000-calorie diet, you need to get 200 to 700 calories from protein every day. There are 4 calories in each gram of protein, so divide the calories by 4 to convert them to grams of protein. This amounts to 50 to 175 grams of protein, based on 2,000 calories, which gives you 2 to 7 percent of the recommended amount of daily protein. Kinds of Minerals Hard-boiled egg whites contain several minerals, just not in large amounts.

And tennis star Venus Williams famously chose a raw vegan regimen five years ago after being diagnosed with Sjogren’s syndrome, an immune-system disorder that caused her joint pain, fatigue and shortness of breath. Along with these stories comes a common query from incredulous non-vegans: “How do you get enough protein?” “It’s always the first question,” says Torre Washington, a bodybuilder who has been following a vegan diet for 18 years, laughing. “But you really don’t need protein to get shredded and lean. I’m looking for nutrients and focused on variety.” Indeed, vegan athletes including Washington and 10-time Olympic medalist Carl Lewis — who retired from athletic competition in 1997 and has said that athletes have “the worst diets in the world and compete in spite of it” — tend to agree that athletes should put an emphasis on increased calories when in training, as opposed to more protein. ||| No, I’m starting to train for a marathon, what is a one week diet?\n",

Besides these values, what other factors could cause stigmatization? ||| (7) However, the stigmatization of mental illness can be influenced by other factors, such as the perceived cause of the illness. In a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a vignette in which an individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded that the individual’s illness was “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants were asked to rate how they would feel if one of their children dated, married, or reproduced with the subject of the vignette. Genetic attribution of mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce among Chinese Americans, but it increased the same measures among European Americans, supporting previous findings of cultural variations in patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)Many studies have reported other significant differences in attitudes towards mental illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song et al. (2010) conducted an intensive 18-month observation-based ethnographic study of 25 severely mentally ill individuals living in inner city Hartford, Connecticut. ||| What about the causes in North America?\n",

Now, what about the causes in Asia? ||| Labels and unfair treatment are results of what we call stigma. Stigma comes from negative and incorrect beliefs, or stereotypes, about groups of people. Fear of being left out or picked on because of who you are is a part of stigma. The effects of stigma can make you feel sad, ashamed or alone. People with mental health challenges sometimes experience stigma. They get called “crazy” or “mental” or “emo.” These labels are based on stereotypes, not on fact. You can help break down stigma by learning and sharing the truth about mental health. Living with mental illness You might not realize it, but you probably know someone who has a mental illness. It could be a friend, family member, classmate, neighbor, or teacher. Lots of famous people have had struggles with mental health, like President Abraham Lincoln and actress Demi Lovato.

A mental illness is not the only thing to know about a person. ||| Is there a relationship between these values and mental illness in the region? ||| Some sub-populations of cultures, such as those from India and Pakistan, are reluctant to accept a diagnosis of severe emotional illness or mental retardation because it severely reduces the chances of other members of the family getting married.

Vietnamese don’t readily accept Western mental health counseling and interventions, particularly when self-disclosure is expected. However, it is possible to accept assistance if trust has been gained. Russian immigrants frequently view U. S. medical care with a degree of mistrust. The Russian experience with medical practitioners has been an authoritarian relationship in which free exchange of information and open discussion was not usual. As a result, many Russian patients find it difficult to question a physician and to talk openly about medical concerns. Patients expect a paternalistic approach-the competent health care professional does not ask patients what they want to do, but tells them what to do. ||| Wow. Besides these values, what other factors could cause stigmatization? ||| (7) However, the stigmatization of mental illness can be influenced by other factors, such as the perceived cause of the illness. In a 2003 study, Chinese Americans and European Americans were presented with a vignette in which an individual was diagnosed with schizophrenia or a major depressive disorder. Participants were then told that experts had concluded that the individual’s illness was “genetic”, “partly genetic”, or “not genetic” in origin, and participants were asked to rate how they would feel if one of their children dated, married, or reproduced with the subject of the vignette. Genetic attribution of mental illness significantly reduced unwillingness to marry and reproduce among Chinese Americans, but it increased the same measures among European Americans, supporting previous findings of cultural variations in patterns of mental illness stigmatization. (8)Many studies have reported other significant differences in attitudes towards mental illness among ethnic groups in the United States. Carpenter-Song et al.

However, the authors note that these figures likely underestimate the extent of stigma associated with mental illness since they only evaluated data on anxiety and mood disorders. (13)Finally, presenting mental health care services in culturally-sensitive ways may be essential to increasing access to and usage of mental health care services, as local beliefs about mental health often differ from the Western biomedical perspective on mental illness. For example, one study comparing Indian and American attitudes toward mental illness surveyed students at a university in the Himalayan region of Northern India and at a university in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. The Indian students were more likely to view depression as arising from personally controllable causes (e.g. failure to achieve goals) and to “endorse social support and spiritual reflection or relaxation” as ways to deal with depression. ||| What are the causes of stigma in Africa? ||| The WHO is working to move other countries' mental health policies forward. Section::::Perspectives. The Southeast African Great Lakes region has a long-standing tribal history of traditional medicine and practices. Although some slight progress has been made with the availability of mental health resources in these areas, still many people in rural Southeast Africa utilize traditional methods to treat mental illness. According to Vikram Patel, a global mental health expert and professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, the stigmatization of mental illness is due to traditional and cultural methods of dealing with these situations and can only be changed through improved support, education, and greater awareness. In traditional Southeast Africa, when there is a situation in which there is a mental health concern, the patient is usually treated without their consent. For example, if the patient is violent or destructive, he is sedated by the traditional healer or by family members in order to commence therapy, and people are often isolated or treated against their will in order to prevent patients from hurting themselves or others. ||| Could you expand on some of these methods? ||| The unique infrageneric diversity of \"Aloe L.\" (\"Aloaceae/Asphodelaceae\") and the broad therapeutic uses in southern Africa, suggest its cultural significance in the subcontinent. Palms are very commonly used as ritual elements, as well as an ingredient in ATM. Some people in Grahamstown, South Africa use traditional plants and weeds as an alternative. \"Cannabis sativa\" (intsango). The fresh leaves are made into a decoction that is taken three times a day to treat asthma, it is also used as steam. In other parts of South Africa it is used to cure bronchitis, headaches, labour pains and hypertension. \"Carduus tenuiflorus\" (uMhlakavuthwa). The plant is used to extricate poison or diseases from a sick person. It is believed the plant sucks out the cause of the illness in itself. \"Datura stramonium\" (uQhwangu-qhwangu). Fresh leaves fare used as a bandage that soothes pain and swelling. It's also used as an antiseptic after circumcision. With the latter, the plant is only used once, it should not be used repetitively as it can be harmful due to its potency. ||| How effective are these methods and could they be combined with Western medicine? ||| African Traditional Medicine still plays a large role in African society. It was found that 45% of the black patients that attended a community mental health clinic had consulted a healer for their problem. Additionally, 26% were simultaneously seeking treatment from both the traditional healers and the psychiatrists. Traditional healers are often instrumental in treating mental illness. Psychological healing relies more on a cultural and emotional understanding than it does on possessing medical knowledge. In an interview, Dr. Mustafa Elmasri, a Gaza psychologist with over twenty years of experience describes how he has often collaborated with African Traditional Medicine. Instead of labelling traditional healers as primitive and demonic, he worked with them and even trained some of them in scientific methods for identifying certain mental illnesses such as epilepsy and psychosis.

So, how to get help to all the people who needed it when there were few financial, technical or material resources? And how to convince people to reach out when their culture made them reluctant to admit their emotional pain for fear of seeming weak or even possessed? To address both, Chibanda stripped mental health care down to basic human connection. He removed the medical and technical elements that made seeking treatment intimidating, and developed a simple solution to enlist the help of lay health workers who could take on matriarchal roles. He first called the meeting spots “mental health benches,” but that was too stigmatizing, so he gave them a more inviting name: “Friendship Benches.” The grandmothers are trained in what is essentially the Western model of cognitive behavioral therapy, but they use indigenous terms that their “patients” can more easily relate to.

Other Christian poems of the late Roman Empire, such as the \"Psychomachia\" of Prudentius, cut back on allusions to Greek mythology, but continue the use of inherited classical forms. Other early Christian poets were more innovative. The hymnodist Venantius Fortunatus wrote a number of important poems that are still used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, such as the \"Vexilla Regis\" (\"The Royal Standard\") and \"Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis\" (\"Sing, O my tongue, of the glorious struggle\"). From a literary and linguistic viewpoint, these hymns represent important innovations; they turn away from Greek prosody and instead seem to have been based on the rhythmic marching songs of Roman armies. ||| That's interesting about Christianity.

The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the Bible, while others provide allegory. Section::::Overview of Christian poetry. Poetic forms have been used by Christians since the recorded history of the faith begins. The earliest Christian poetry, in fact, appears in the New Testament. Canticles such as the \"Magnificat\" and \"Nunc Dimittis\", which appear in the Gospel of Luke, take the Biblical poetry of the psalms of the Hebrew Bible as their models. Many Biblical scholars also believe that St Paul of Tarsus quotes bits of early Christian hymns in his epistles. Passages such as Philippians 2:5-11 (following) are thought by many Biblical scholars to represent early Christian hymns that were being quoted by the Apostle: Within the world of classical antiquity, Christian poets often struggled with their relationship to the existing traditions of Greek and Latin poetry, which were of course heavily influenced by paganism. ||| How did those traditions affect them? ||| Paul quotes the pagan poets Aratus and Epimenides in Acts 17:28: \"For in him we live, and move, and have our being: as certain also of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'\" Some early Christian poets such as Ausonius continued to include allusions to pagan deities and standard classical figures and allusions continued to appear in his verse. Other Christian poems of the late Roman Empire, such as the \"Psychomachia\" of Prudentius, cut back on allusions to Greek mythology, but continue the use of inherited classical forms. Other early Christian poets were more innovative. The hymnodist Venantius Fortunatus wrote a number of important poems that are still used in the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, such as the \"Vexilla Regis\" (\"The Royal Standard\") and \"Pange, lingua, gloriosi proelium certaminis\" (\"Sing, O my tongue, of the glorious struggle\"). From a literary and linguistic viewpoint, these hymns represent important innovations; they turn away from Greek prosody and instead seem to have been based on the rhythmic marching songs of Roman armies. ||| That's interesting about Christianity.

How does the use of rhyme in Biblical poetry compare? ||| The Arabs have always used rhymes extensively, most notably in their long, rhyming qasidas. Some classical poetry forms, such as Venpa of the Tamil language, had rigid grammars (to the point that they could be expressed as a context-free grammar), which ensured a rhythm. Alliteration played a key role in structuring early Germanic and English forms of poetry (called alliterative verse), akin to the role of rhyme in later European poetry. The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry and the rhyme schemes of Modern European poetry alike both include meter as a key part of their structure, which determines when the listener expects instances of rhyme or alliteration to occur. In this sense, both alliteration and rhyme, when used in poetic structures, help to emphasise and define a rhythmic pattern. By contrast, the chief device of Biblical poetry in ancient Hebrew was parallelism, a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three; a verse form that lent itself to antiphonal or call- and-response performance. ||| Why didn't it use rhymes as much?\n",

Metrical rhythm generally involves precise arrangements of stresses or syllables into repeated patterns called feet within a line. In Modern English verse the pattern of stresses primarily differentiate feet, so rhythm based on meter in Modern English is most often founded on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables (alone or elided). In the classical languages, on the other hand, while the metrical units are similar, vowel length rather than stresses define the meter. Old English poetry used a metrical pattern involving varied numbers of syllables but a fixed number of strong stresses in each line. The chief device of ancient Hebrew Biblical poetry, including many of the psalms, was \"parallelism\", a rhetorical structure in which successive lines reflected each other in grammatical structure, sound structure, notional content, or all three. Parallelism lent itself to antiphonal or call-and-response performance, which could also be reinforced by intonation. Thus, Biblical poetry relies much less on metrical feet to create rhythm, but instead creates rhythm based on much larger sound units of lines, phrases and sentences. ||| Ahh, it seems like rhyming and parallelism share similar functions.

How did both types of poetry influence other kinds of poetry? ||| Rhymed prose Rhymed prose is a literary form and literary genre, written in unmetrical rhymes. This form has been known in many different cultures. In some cases the rhymed prose is a distinctive, well-defined style of writing. In modern literary traditions the boundaries of poetry are very broad (free verse, prose poetry, etc.), and some works may be described both as prose and poetry. Section::::Arabic culture and influences. In classic Arabic literature the rhymed prose is called \"saj'\". An elaborate Arabic kind of rhymed prose is \"maqama\". It influenced other cultures of the Muslim world, such as Persian (as exemplified by Saadi's \"Gulestan\") and Turkish (). \"Maqama\" also influenced the medieval Hebrew literature, a significant amount of which was produced by Jews of the Muslim world. It influenced the style of Yehuda Alharizi, Ibn Zabara, Ibn Hasdai (Abraham ben Samuel ha-Levi ibn Hasdai), Ibn Sahula, Jacob ben Eleazer. The corresponding works were called \"maqamat\" or \"mahbarot\" (\"mahberot\", e.g., \"Mahbarot Emmanuel\", by Immanuel the Roman). ||| Did Biblical poetry have a similar impact?\n",

SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter.

International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts. ||| Okay, but I meant their response to the EndSars protests.\n",

The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves. ||| My friend also mentioned that women were instrumental to the movement.

SARS formed in 1992 to combat armed robbery with “the element of surprise,” founder Simeon Danladi Midenda told the Nigerian news site Vanguard. “The secret behind the successes of the original SARS was its facelessness,” the former police commissioner said in the 2017 interview. “We operated in plain clothes and used plain vehicles that could not be associated with security or any government agency.” But over the years, critics say, officers took advantage of that stealth mandate, ordering people off the road and taking their valuables without cause. “SARS has made itself a nuisance and a tool of oppression,” said JJ Omojuwa, a Nigerian blogger with 933,000 followers on Twitter. Temi Afolabi, a lawyer in Lagos, said officers have a reputation for searching phones at random and detaining people for outrageous reasons. ||| What's an example of those reasons? ||| The officers, who often worked in plain clothes, developed a reputation for stopping young people, accusing them of theft and then stealing their money, activists say. The Nigerian Police Force said it has fired at least two officers since the demonstrations began and has said it would probe past atrocities with the help of civil society leaders. Amnesty International said it has documented 82 cases of the squad’s abuses in the past three years, including beating, hanging, mock execution, sexual assault and waterboarding. In Lagos, chaos escalated on Tuesday following news reports that officers had killed two people. A crowd torched a police station, and protesters blocked roads. Police deployed anti-riot officers to “protect the lives and property of all Nigerians and secure critical national infrastructure across the country,” the department said in a statement. The crisis intensified as Nigeria grapples with the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic on top of an Islamist insurgency in the northeast — both of which have fueled resentment among its 200 million people. ||| How did the international community respond? ||| One month after the kidnapping of more than 300 students in Chibok, Nigeria, international teams from the U.S., U.K., China, France  and Israel have arrived in Nigeria to assist local authorities in the hunt for the 276 girls who are still missing. International outcry, which took off in social media via the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls on Twitter and Instagram, has drawn so much attention to the crisis as to make it impossible for Nigeria’s leaders to ignore. The role of these teams is primarily advisory. It’s highly unlikely a team of Chinese commandos will descend into the Sambisa forest to rescue the girls. Instead, assistance to Nigeria in the hunt for the Chibok girls is centered around expertise in locating them, negotiations with Boko Haram for their release, ensuring that potential rescue attempts don’t cause more harm than good and assisting returned girls with counseling and other needed services. While some are calling for  U.S. military action to rescue the Chibok girls, realistically, the task of saving and protecting them will fall largely to Nigeria’s security and intelligence services, with the assistance of the outside experts. ||| Okay, but I meant their response to the EndSars protests. ||| What started as a grass-roots movement to end police brutality in Africa’s most populous country has become a global phenomenon embraced by the world’s biggest celebrities: #EndSARS. In the two weeks since Nigerians began flooding the streets to rally against a police unit widely viewed as abusive, overseas megastars such as Beyoncé, Rihanna, Cardi B and Drake have thrown their fame behind the cause. Now the protest is dominating social media feeds on practically every continent and, by Wednesday, had made its way into the U.S. presidential race. “The United States must stand with Nigerians who are peacefully demonstrating for police reform and seeking an end to corruption in their democracy,” Democratic nominee Joe Biden said in a statement. Attention to the movement skyrocketed after Tuesday night, when protesters and human rights groups say Nigerian soldiers opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in Lagos, a metropolis of approximately 20 million. “There was no warning,” one protester told The Washington Post, like others speaking on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. ||| Did that help? ||| As Human Rights Watch’s Sarah Margon notes, any action to assist the Nigerian army is fraught with moral hazard; this is an army that is responsible for almost as many abuses against civilians in northeastern Nigeria as Boko Haram itself. There are few alternatives to doing so, however. The Nigerian army is not going to disappear, which is why Margon is right to argue that assistance in fighting Boko Haram should be part of a more comprehensive effort to improve respect for human rights in Nigeria’s armed forces. For ordinary Nigerians, though, the problem of lacking basic protection remains. This is true throughout Nigeria, not just in Boko Haram-affected areas. Nigeria’s police are often corrupt, under-equipped and incapable of reaching crime scenes in a timely fashion. In the northeast, even when communities have warning of an attack — as was apparently the case in Chibok — neither the police nor the army can be counted upon to respond quickly enough to stop such abuses. Faced with a government that cannot protect their property or lives, some Nigerians in the northeast are creating vigilante groups to do so themselves. ||| My friend also mentioned that women were instrumental to the movement. What was their role? ||| Nigeria’s #EndSARS movement has spawned over 150 mass protests in cities across the country, with demonstrations intensifying after soldiers reportedly fired live rounds into protesters at the Lekki toll plaza in Lagos on Oct. 20. The movement has also inspired solidarity protests in major cities of the world, including London, New York, Berlin and Washington. Women play a leading role in the ongoing #EndSARS movement against police brutality and government violence in Nigeria, specifically seeking to abolish a federal police unit called the Special Anti-Robbery Squad. One nascent women’s group in particular, the Feminist Coalition, has used digital platforms to mobilize funds and design strategies to support protesters across Nigeria. The Feminist Coalition’s work in the #EndSARS movement continues a long history of women leading and supporting political mobilizations across Africa. This engagement, however, has typically been minimized or ignored outright in the retelling of the events. Here’s what you need to know. Who are the Feminist Coalition? In July, Damilola Odufuwa and Odunayo Eweniyi, both under 30, formed the Feminist Coalition activist group alongside 12 other young women. ||| That's cool. Tell me more about them. ||| The group advocates equality for women in Nigeria through a focus on advancing education, financial freedom and representation in public office. Based in Lagos, the group uses online platforms for its work. The Feminist Coalition gained popularity when it took on a central role in the #EndSARS protests just two months later. It raised and managed funds for the movement, established a legal aid service made up of volunteers, and coordinated help lines to align efforts across the country. Nigeria’s Feminist Coalition capitalizes on mobile apps Communication technologies have facilitated the #EndSARS protests. The online mobilization effort has garnered global support, generating over 28 million tweets within 48 hours of the online campaign’s kickoff on Oct. 8. The speed and reach of new technologies have enabled efficient communication of information for community building and collaboration. These technologies also helped the #EndSARS movement navigate the Nigerian government’s responses to the protests. Through WhatsApp and Twitter, activists shared information, reaching a wide network of supporters. Real-time transmission of texts, pictures and videos of the protests and violence by police and soldiers also prompted swift domestic and international condemnation of the Nigerian government. ||| There was mention of the protection of Black lives earlier. How is it related to this movement? ||| A central question is: Can #BlackLivesMatter protests effect meaningful change in government? My book, “Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State,” examined an earlier movement focused on the protection of black lives. I studied archival materials of the battle by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) against lynching and mob violence from 1909 to 1923. My research showed how the NAACP raised public awareness, met with American presidents, secured the support of Members of Congress, and won a consequential criminal justice victory in the Supreme Court. Drawing from the book’s findings, we can identify three key things to know about ongoing #BlackLivesMatter protests: 1. The fight to protect black lives from unjust state violence has deep historical roots Some people, including Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, have expressed confusion as to why protesters believe recent police misconduct is emblematic of a system of racial injustice and not just a few bad apples. For many blacks, what is happening right now is not new; it is grounded in a documented history of state violence against black citizens. ||| What role did women play in that?\n",

Fashion merchandising bachelor's degrees are another option for those aspiring to enter all fashion journalism fields. Because the job markets in the fashion and journalism industries can be competitive, you may want to pursue a college internship in your professional area of interest. Some journalism degree programs may offer concentrations in fashion or magazine writing; the latter may be appropriate for those aspiring to work for fashion magazines. If you pursue a degree in general journalism, one or several fashion writing classes are likely available to you. Some schools may also offer special seminars, clubs or other activities for journalism students interested in fashion. Fashion journalism courses or concentrations teach you about relevant general and journalism-specific concepts, such as visual merchandising, textiles, fashion marketing, event reporting, trend analysis and designer collection reviews. You also study basic journalism topics like news reporting, mass media and society magazine writing, opinion commentary, copyediting, promotional writing and media law. ||| Not quite.

S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median annual salary for veterinarians in May 2015 was $88,490. To become a vet, a doctorate degree in veterinary medicine is required and you must pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam to earn licensure. There may be additional licensure requirements specific to each state. Employers may have different experience requirements. The keys skills you'll need in this career include critical thinking, complex problem solving, decision-making, speaking, and active listening. You'll also need proficiency with scientific software, and physical dexterity to use X-Ray, surgical and laboratory equipment. How to Become a Veterinarian Follow these steps to become a veterinarian: Step 1: Complete a Bachelor's Degree Program Most schools of veterinary medicine require or prefer applicants to have a bachelor's degree. While many students earn their degree in a biological science, most veterinary schools don't have a preferred major as long as certain science courses are taken. ||| What are the other steps? ||| This exam measures a person's readiness for graduate-level studies. Step 2: Earn a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Each successive year in a program of veterinary medicine builds upon the previous year's curriculum. The first year or two may focus on science subjects like animal anatomy and physiology, nutrition, and virology. These and related courses lay the basic framework for understanding veterinary medicine. Some courses might be specific to an animal group. The third year may focus on clinical studies in which students come in to contact with living animals and practice using the knowledge and skills they've gained in the previous two years to make diagnoses and recommend possible treatments. The fourth year is usually spent participating in applied experiences, such as practicums or externships. Get involved in research projects. Some programs offer students the opportunity to be involved in research while studying for their degree. This experience may be helpful in understanding certain aspects of the veterinary field and can open up opportunities to work in research rather than a clinical setting. ||| I understand that licenses are required. Tell me more about that. ||| It's during veterinary school that many students decide to concentrate on becoming large animal vets, dealing with farm animals, such as horses and cows, or small animal vets, dealing with domestic pets, such as dogs and cats. Following graduation, some individuals choose to participate in a 1-year internship to fine-tune their veterinary skills and possibly secure more rapid advancement in the field. Licensure Requirements With the occasional exception of employment by federal or state governments, all states and the District of Columbia require newly graduated veterinarians to pass the North American Veterinary Licensing Examination, in order to practice. D. V. M. candidates must pass an examination on state laws and regulations governing the field of veterinary medicine. Most states require veterinarians to participate in continuing education dealing with newly discovered diseases and newly developed treatments in order to renew a vet's license on a regular basis. Because there is little reciprocity between states, as a general rule, veterinarians who move to a new state must pass that state's licensure examinations. ||| What about a way to combine both of my interests?\n",

Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem. ||| How dangerous could these be?\n",

Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it.

How can I treat it at home? ||| Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic). ||| My cat is also having similar symptoms.

While there have been some dogs affected by coronaviruses, this coronavirus (which causes the disease covid-19) is not thought to be a threat to dogs or cats. There’s no evidence that domestic pets play “a significant role in spreading the virus,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can pet your dog, walk your dog and play with your dog without worry of contracting the virus from the animal. “If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets,” the CDC recommends. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is spread primarily when infected people cough and sneeze submicroscopic droplets onto smooth surfaces or onto other people. No special precautions need to be taken with the dog; just practice normal hygiene. Check with your veterinarian for more information. P.S.: It is not necessary for your dog to wear a mask over his nose and mouth, although it does make quite a picture to post! ||| Okay, but I also heard that a few have been reported to be infected.\n",

You can pet your dog, walk your dog and play with your dog without worry of contracting the virus from the animal. “If a person inside the household becomes sick, isolate that person from everyone else, including pets,” the CDC recommends. Coronavirus is a respiratory virus that is spread primarily when infected people cough and sneeze submicroscopic droplets onto smooth surfaces or onto other people. No special precautions need to be taken with the dog; just practice normal hygiene. Check with your veterinarian for more information. P.S.: It is not necessary for your dog to wear a mask over his nose and mouth, although it does make quite a picture to post! ||| Okay, but I also heard that a few have been reported to be infected. ||| A pet dog in Hong Kong has a “low-level” infection of the coronavirus that causes covid-19 in people, in what may be the first known human-to-animal transmission of the novel coronavirus that has sickened more than 90,000 people worldwide. The case has raised the specter that dogs might be swept into the epidemic, which, even now, public health officials say does not appear to infect or be spread by pets. But experts say much remains unknown about the dog’s infection, and they emphasized the lone case is not yet cause for alarm or reassessments about interactions with pets. The dog is owned by a person who was hospitalized with covid-19, and it has been quarantined since Feb. 26, according to Hong Kong’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. The department said last week that the dog’s “weak positive” test results, from nasal and oral swabs, might have been the result of “environmental contamination,” not infection. But positive tests since then suggest the dog does have a low-level of infection, the department said Wednesday. ||| How can I protect them?\n",

      "My dog has been shaking and tilting its head a lot recently. What could be wrong? ||| This was cause for concern and we were going to check his ears when we got home. He kept shaking and shaking ... and then we saw an ant waltz out of his ear. There was our culprit. The shaking stopped. When an especially mean stray tick got on Jasmine's ear, her instinct was to shake her head. (Stray tick because it was one of the only two we ever found at the ranch.) The bite was painful for Jasmine though, so every time she started to shake her head she'd cry a little, stop and hold her head down, tilted towards the affected ear. This immediately alerted us to a problem and we found and removed the invader. When your dog starts shaking their head like that, examine the ears, eyes, head, neck and skin carefully. Pay particularly close attention to the ears. Some culprits are obvious and easy to deal with. Some require attention of your veterinarian. A common cause of head shaking is otitis, inflammation of the ear canal. ||| I just checked and there’s swelling in the outer portion. What could it be? ||| Home Swollen Ear Ear Care: Swollen Dog Ear Quick Links Overview Problems Infections Scratching Itching Swelling Treatment Reader &amp; Vet Q&amp;ACauses: The most common and famous reason amongst researchers for dog swollen ear is inflammation. Inflammation can occur for any reason such as infection, allergy, parasitic infestation, tumors or any injury. Inflammation is an acute (immediate) response of the body towards any pathological (disease) condition, thus swelling as a characteristic of inflammation may be the result of any dog ear problem. Another common cause of dog swollen ear is a hematoma. Canine ear hematoma refers to the accumulation of fluids and blood in between the skin and cartilage of the ear. Most of the time it occurs over the flap of the ear, but it may also occur in the inner cavities of the ear. Hematomas may cause inflammation as a secondary character, which means as a result of another condition. Hematomas are caused by any mechanical injury or vigorous head shakes, which are also related to the underlying ear problem. ||| How dangerous could these be? ||| Each hospital is different though and you should talk with the veterinarians in your area. Hematomas don't just appear. There is a problem that caused it. The most common is an ear infection but it can also be rough play with another dog or trauma. If the hematoma reaches the base of the ear and you let it heal naturally it can close off the ear canal and condemn your dog to chronic and painful ear infections. If it is just at the tip then you are looking at an aesthetic change only and it's not as much of a concern. The cause of the hematoma still needs to be addressed though. The healing process can take anywhere from 2-12 weeks depending on if the dog keeps re-injuring it. Good luck to you and your pooch.23.9k Views · View Upvoters · Answer requested by Aubrey Brennan Your response is private. Is this answer still relevant and up to date? David Nichols, DVM SK'84. ||| I live in a remote area. How can I treat it at home? ||| Instead of putting the vinegar in the dog’s ear, mix 2 tablespoons of it with a cup of water and have the dog drink it all. This can be repeated on a daily basis until the infection clears up. Garlic has also been found to be a good home remedy because of the herb’s antibiotic properties. One just needs to mash two cloves of garlic with a cup of olive oil and let it sit for two weeks. After two weeks, strain the mixture and warm it up a bit. Then place 2 to 3 drops of oil in the infected ear until the infection clears-up. This is a good remedy if a dog is prone to frequent infections because of the time it takes to make. However, if one does not have the premade solution on hand, oil from a garlic gel capsule can be used. If a dog’s ear infection does not seem to get better with the use of home remedies, consult a veterinarian (traditional or holistic). ||| My cat is also having similar symptoms. Would that work for her as well? ||| WARNING: Do not use this method if the ears are red and swollen or have any open wounds. Garlic and Olive Oil combined are great for treating ear mites. Crush garlic and soak it overnight in warm olive oil. Throw away the clove and warm up the olive oil. Add 5 drops to each ear for 21 days. This remedy also smothers the ear mites. My favorite is Aloe and Calendula essential oils. They are very soothing to the kitty’s ears and have worked wonders for getting rid of the ear mites. Both oils are available at your local health food store. Add several drops to the kitty’s ears once daily for 21 days. The oils have a healing effect so if your kitty has inflamed or painful ears, this will help. These are the best remedies for cats with ear mites and now you can choose the conventional or the holistic approach. Your cat will feel much better and she will love you for it. ||| Thanks.

The feline coronavirus can remain inactive and harmless in the home, but it is very easy to destroy the virus with regular cleaning habits. The feline coronavirus poses no threat to humans. How to Prevent the Feline Coronavirus and FIP While it is impossible to know which cats will develop the FIP condition after being infected with the coronavirus, there are several things pet owners can do to possibly prevent the coronavirus from occurring in the first place. Making sure your cat's healthy and has a strong immune system is important in preventing disease. Providing proper nutrition, exercise, and a low-stress environment is the best way to keep your pet healthy. Keeping cats overcrowded may increase stress, lower immunity, and may spread viruses easily, so it is best not to allow this to happen. Comments ||| Ok. But what about my dog?\n",

That dependence, coupled with financial difficulties that would compel him to agree to a demanding string of performances in London in 2009, set the table for Jackson to become more reliant on Murray, a doctor facing his own money troubles. “Dr. Conrad Murray was not, nor ever would have been, suited to be the caretaker of a complicated patient like Michael Jackson,” the authors state. “And from the moment they met, their fate was sealed.” “83 Minutes” returns often to this idea that Jackson’s demise was inevitable, not only because of Murray’s negligence, but also because of previous doctors who accommodated Jackson’s desire for propofol and other drugs, and Jackson himself, who apparently considered himself immune to the risks. Even though followers of the Murray case and fans of Jackson may be aware of many of the details outlined in “83 Minutes,” revisiting all the pieces of the puzzle in a single volume has a powerful narrative effect. ||| Okay.

Power cuts. Crop slumps. The past twelve months has seen Brazil being hit harder and harder by the effects of drought, as first São Paulo, then other regions of the country, struggle to cope with dwindling supplies of water but an immense demand. Local reservoirs are running at historic lows, such as the Cantareira system – which supplies water to over a quarter of the 20 million São Paulo residents and is currently down to only five per cent of its 264 billion gallon capacity. A ‘five-days-off, two-days-on’ rationing system is currently being proposed as a solution to prevent the reservoir running completely dry. The proposed reasons for the drought are plentiful. ||| I also heard that other Latin American countries had coffee production issues. Was the disruption widespread?\n",

Starbucks even bought a Costa Rican farm for research purposes. USAID intends to work with Texas A&amp;M to step up research on rust-resistant coffee varieties and help Latin America better monitor and respond to the fungus. The United States already collaborates with some of the coffee companies and other international organizations to finance replanting of different varieties of trees.

The Global Cities Initiative, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and JPMorgan Chase, will oversee an in-depth study to help the area figure out how to boost exports to offset some of the economic pain caused by the slowdown in federal spending. A coalition of three regional organizations — representing government, businesses and universities — asked for the help by applying to join the initiative. They did so because the Washington area, despite including a major world capital, is near the bottom of the heap when it comes to doing business overseas. Among the nation’s 100 largest metropolitan areas, Washington ranks 98th in the share of its economic activity fueled by exports, according to Brookings. That contributed to the region’s weak economic growth rate from 2010 to 2014, which ranked 93rd. Greater Washington’s entry in the initiative was perhaps the most significant of a series of recent efforts to foster increased cooperation among the District, Northern Virginia and the Maryland suburbs in response to the federal spending cuts known as sequestration. ||| No, I want to know what they did to help with the coffee rust epidemic in Latin America. ||| And even when it does, it might be struck by the rust fungus as well. As a solution, scientists are currently looking for and breeding rust-resistant coffee varieties (USAID recently donated $5 million towards this goal). Still, there are even reasons to think that these efforts will be futile. \"\"Coffee doesn't have a very broad genetic base,\"\"Lombardini says. \"\"It originated from just a few plants that were taken out of Ethiopia a few hundred years ago, so it has a very narrow, homogenous genome. \"\"This means that finding variations that might allow for rust-resistance will be difficult. Even if they're identified, a mutation in the fungus' genome could easily allow it to conquer the resistant plants. \"\" My worry is that producers will over-plant this variety and when the inevitable mutant rust strain capable of infecting it arrives, we will be back to where we are now,\"\" Arneson says. And even apart from coffee rust, there are other long-term trends that suggest coffee prices will just continue rising. ||| Okay. What did big coffee companies do? How did they try to help? ||| Still, the companies are trying to ensure their future supply is not affected, so they are working closely with growers on better practices that will help them avoid contamination. “Supporting the farmer’s ability to access information, technology and resources allows them to adapt to these uncertainties and ensures the longevity of our industry’s supply chain,” said Craig Russell, Starbucks Global Coffee executive vice president. Starbucks even bought a Costa Rican farm for research purposes. USAID intends to work with Texas A&amp;M to step up research on rust-resistant coffee varieties and help Latin America better monitor and respond to the fungus. The United States already collaborates with some of the coffee companies and other international organizations to finance replanting of different varieties of trees. The effort is part of the Obama administration’s Feed the Future program, which aims to help rid the world of extreme poverty through agricultural development and improved nutrition. While the effort has helped hungry children around the globe, “we’re at risk of backtracking because of coffee rust,” Shah says. ||| How did all these affect global consumption? ||| When other commodities get expensive, usage can be curtailed — if corn prices went up significantly, for example, Coke might use sugar or another sweetener instead of high-fructose corn syrup in its beverages. The reduced demand for corn helps slow the increase in the cost of it. this years' El niño could bring drought to coffee-growing countries in central america For the most part, coffee doesn't work this way. An estimated54 percent of American adults drink coffee every day, and tea won't suffice. Coffee is an exotic plant that can only be grown in very specific ecosystems thousands of miles away, but we've come to see it as a daily staple, and many Americans who depend on drinking it will do so regardless of price increases. There are also longer-term problems that might cause coffee prices to continue rising in the coming years. One is that substantial solutions to the problems of drought and coffee rust take time. Unlike say, corn, planting more coffee during the next growing season won't mean more beans are available at the next harvest — it takes several years for a coffee plant to reach maturity. ||| That’s interesting, consumption is not very elastic.

The senator has made an “uneventful recovery” from his heart attack, LeWinter said, adding that Sanders has been taking several medications routinely prescribed after heart attacks. “While he did suffer modest heart muscle damage, he has been doing very well since,” LeWinter wrote. LeWinter’s letter was one of three provided by the Sanders campaign, which had said it would release the candidate’s health records by the end of the year. ||| Okay. What did the records say? ||| Bernie Sanders has done something unusual for him: He changed his mind. While in most cases that’s a good thing (I have come out in favor of flip-flopping), this time it’s getting Sanders into trouble, because what he changed his mind about is releasing his medical records. But before you get too up in arms, we should realize that this issue is less clear-cut than it looks. In a CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Sanders was asked if he would release his full medical records, which he said last year that he would do. He has released three letters, from his cardiologists in Vermont and the congressional physician, providing some details of his current health status and prior history. But now, when asked if he’ll be releasing more records, Sanders answered, “I don’t think we will.” Then his spokesperson went on TV and seemed to compare the request for medical records to the racist “birther” campaign against Barack Obama, saying this is reminiscent of “smear” campaigns against other candidates, “questioning where they’re from, their lineage.” That didn’t help. ||| Okay, I'd like to know more about his decision. ||| Sanders, who has committed to releasing his medical records before the first primary votes but has not yet done so, said Tuesday he would provide the information at “the appropriate time.” Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) — fellow septuagenarians who join Sanders at the top of most polls — have also committed to releasing their medical records. Sanders met reporters outside his Burlington home where he has spent the past few days with family, making calls and recovering from a heart attack he suffered during a grass roots fundraising event in Las Vegas last week. The 78-year-old felt chest pains last Tuesday night and was taken to a hospital, where doctors inserted two stents into a blocked artery. By Monday, he was back in Burlington, taking a walk with his wife, Jane, and addressing his campaign on a staff-wide conference call. The campaign had not initially disclosed that Sanders had suffered a heart attack, acknowledging at first only that the stents had been implanted. ||| What about the other candidates? Did they release theirs? ||| The Democratic presidential candidates have been sparring over whether Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been adequately forthcoming about his medical records. At a debate in Las Vegas this month, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg said Sanders needs to disclose “full medical records, do a physical, and release the readout.” The Sanders campaign says demanding greater detail on Sanders’s health resembles “the kind of smear” that demands for Barack Obama’s birth certificate represented. It’s easy to understand why Sanders is not eager to release more of his health history. He’s a 78-year-old who weighs 179 pounds and recently had a heart attack. And he’s not the only one. Of the major Democratic candidates, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) have released comprehensive medical reports. Of course, President Trump as a candidate famously released — in lieu of his physical — a letter from a doctor declaring that “if elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” — a letter it later emerged that Trump had dictated himself. ||| Should there be an age limit on the presidency?\n",

CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily.

Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc. Rather than training people to become very good at a few exercises, CrossFit prompts them to do things that people do in real life, such as getting up and raising things off the ground, Berger says. ||| That sounds very intense but useful for me.

What role will diet play? ||| Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder. Make sure to eat something that is easily digested and nutritious about half an hour before you exercise. ||| What other meal frequencies can I try?\n",

Some medical professionals have asserted that both the CrossFit methodology and the environment created by CrossFit trainers put athletes at high risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. A man successfully sued his uncertified CrossFit trainers and was awarded US$300,000 in damages, after he suffered from rhabdomyolysis after performing a CrossFit workout on December 11, 2005, at Manassas World Gym in Manassas, Virginia, under the said trainers' supervision. CrossFit, Inc. was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit. CrossFit, Inc. does not dispute that its methodology has the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis.

A CrossFit box in Connecticut calls itself “CrossFit Religion” with the motto “In WOD we Trust,” referring to the Workout of the Day that is the foundation of the practice of CrossFit. But J.C. Herz, author of “Learning to Breathe Fire: The Rise of CrossFit and the Primal Future of Fitness,” says that she would class CrossFit as “spiritual but not religious,” similar to yoga. But while many yoga instructors tend to focus more on calming the mind and body, Herz says that CrossFit is spiritual in that every workout asks you to dig deeply. In an age where many are opting out of organized religion, CrossFit provides a rare place of community and holistic transformation. It may not be religious institutionally, but CrossFit does a better job than many religious communities in transforming people’s lives. It may seem strange for what is essentially a fitness program, but CrossFit involves an identity shift that carries over into life well beyond the gym. ||| I’ve got four weeks. What about cardio? ||| Conclusion Any exercise is bad for you if you overdo it. You can beat yourself into the ground with weight training just as well as with cardio. To borrow a famous phrase, you could do chronic Crossfit just as easily as chronic cardio – and it would be just as dangerous. But it’s time to separate cardio from the “more is better” philosophy. More is not better, but there’s a way to enjoy cardiovascular exercise without compromising your recovery or health!Again, this doesn’t mean that cardio is healthy for everyone, or that it’s required for physical fitness. Every person has a different body type, and different body types are naturally better suited to different exercises. Some people do not do well with cardio, and that’s perfectly fine: just don’t do it. The point of this article isn’t to push cardio on people whose bodies don’t respond to it; it’s to point out that some of us are built more for distance work, and that’s OK, too. ||| Okay. What role will diet play? ||| Intense exercise triggers this process. Your body will be working overtime - even after you are done exercising - to replace this lost energy which will result in more calories burned. The body adapts under intensity so the harder you push yourself the more your body adapts to being able to function at higher intensities. Ease into it working up to going “all out” and increasing the number of intervals you do. Mix it up with longer (60 sec. to 5 min.) and shorter (20-60 sec.) intervals - followed by a short recovery period (half the duration of the intense time)Interval training will work as long as you are supporting it with good nutrition. Choosing meals full of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins and healthy fats. Split your meals into six smaller meals spread throughout the day to increase your metabolism. Remember to eat before you exercise - eating before training gives your body the ability to exercise harder. Make sure to eat something that is easily digested and nutritious about half an hour before you exercise. ||| What other meal frequencies can I try? ||| Intermittent fasting allows the body to use fat as it’s primary source of energy instead of sugar. Many athletes now use fasting as means to hitting low body fat percentages for competitions.2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity Fasting has shown to have a positive effect on insulin sensitivity, allowing you to tolerate carbohydrates (sugar) better than if you didn’t fast. A study showed that after periods of fasting, insulin becomes more effective in telling cells to take up glucose from blood.3. Fasting Speeds Up The Metabolism Intermittent fasting gives your digestive system a rest, and this can energise your metabolism to burn through calories more efficiently. If your digestion is poor, this can effect your ability to metabolise food and burn fat. Intermittent fasts can regulate your digestion and promote healthy bowel function, thus improving your metabolic function.4. Fasting Promotes Longevity Believe it or not, the less you eat the longer you will live.

      "I'm about to become a dad and I want to get fit before it gets too hard. How do I get started? ||| Watching a video of my daughter, I catch myself in the background and think, Ugh, you’re moving like him already? I worry that my daughter will someday wish I’d work the burger line at the team picnic rather than make her cringe by joining in the game. This anxiety isn’t just mine. In the time I’ve been alive, the average age for becoming a father in America has climbed 3 1 / 2 years, to 30.9, and higher for the college-educated. But that doesn’t mean we’re older versions of our dads. Just as the boomers who came after my dad discovered jogging and yoga and aerobics, my generation of parents has found its own approach to fitness. We’re the ones who entered adulthood — and who now approach middle age — not just clinging to shreds of our athletic identity but fully expecting that our best physical years are still ahead of us. It’s us driving the growth of high-intensity exercise chains like CrossFit and Orangetheory. ||| Okay. Should I try CrossFit? ||| It seems as though nearly everyone who has heard of CrossFit has an opinion about it — even people who have never tried it. Aficionados claim that this brand of high-intensity workouts is a fast and fun way to get fit. Critics say that it’s a fast track to injury. CrossFit workouts mix weightlifting exercises, gymnastics and cardio activities such as jump rope and rowing into short, intense combinations that change daily. A typical “workout of the day” (WOD) might consist of running 400 meters, then doing 21 kettlebell swings and 12 pull-ups before repeating this sequence two more times. One recent WOD gave participants 20 minutes to complete as many rounds as possible of 10 push-ups, 20 pull-ups and 30 lunges. Besides the intensity factor, what distinguishes CrossFit from other gym-based workouts is its constantly changing exercises and emphasis on moves — bending and squatting, for example — that are functional in everyday life, says Russell Berger, a head trainer for CrossFit Inc. Rather than training people to become very good at a few exercises, CrossFit prompts them to do things that people do in real life, such as getting up and raising things off the ground, Berger says. ||| That sounds very intense but useful for me.

Studies have shown how the lifespan of people in certain cultures increased due to their diets. ||| Which one’s better? ||| It’s one less decision you have to make every day. It could allow you to enjoy bigger portioned meals (thus making your tastebuds and stomach satiated) and STILL eat fewer calories on average. It requires less time (and potentially less money). Rather than having to prepare or purchase three to six meals a day, you only need to prepare two meals. Instead of stopping what you’re doing six times a day to eat, you simply only have to stop to eat twice. Rather than having to do the dishes six times, you only have to do them twice. Rather than having to purchase six meals a day, you only need to purchase two. It promotes stronger insulin sensitivity and increased growth hormone secretion, two keys for weight loss and muscle gain. Intermittent fasting helps you create a double whammy for weight loss and building a solid physique. It can level up your brain, including positively counteracting conditions like Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and dementia. As explained here in this TEDx talk by Mark Mattson, Professor at Johns Hopkins University and Chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging fasting is grounded in serious research and more studies are coming out showing the benefits: Why fasting bolsters brain power: Mark Mattson at TEDx Johns Hopkins University Your browser does not currently recognize any of the video formats available. ||| Okay.

Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. ||| Okay.

Can you tell me about the time when dinosaurs actually existed? ||| When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive. Geological Timescale You’ve probably heard of the Jurassic period – or at least the word ‘Jurassic’ – from the Jurassic Park films (which starred a T Rex, which was, er, from the Cretaceous period). ||| Hmm. What else was characteristic about that era? ||| \"Mesozoic Era (245 to 65 mya)One of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. ||| Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? ||| This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. ||| What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? ||| Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. ||| That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? ||| The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. ||| Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? ||| It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (\"\"ruling reptiles\"\"), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. ||| What about the second?\n",

At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out!

      "I just watched the first Jurassic Park movie and I got interested in dinosaurs and their time on earth. Can you tell me about the time when dinosaurs actually existed? ||| When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Discover the Mesozoic Era In this article, we ask ‘When were dinosaurs alive?’ and explore the different periods of the Mesozoic Era. This article is part of our Dinosaur Facts series. When Were Dinosaurs Alive? Dinosaurs first appeared between 243 and 231 million years ago. This was during the Triassic period, which is part of the ‘geological timescale’. We’ll take a closer look at the geological timescale further down the page. Dinosaurs lived on Earth for many millions of years. In fact, they were alive right up to the end of the Cretaceous period, around 66 million years ago. This means that dinosaurs were alive for as long as 177 million years, for much of the Triassic period, and for all of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. A simple dinosaur timescale at the end of this article shows when dinosaurs were alive. Geological Timescale You’ve probably heard of the Jurassic period – or at least the word ‘Jurassic’ – from the Jurassic Park films (which starred a T Rex, which was, er, from the Cretaceous period). ||| Hmm. What else was characteristic about that era? ||| \"Mesozoic Era (245 to 65 mya)One of the most striking events in the Mesozoic Era was the rise to dominance of dinosaurs in terrestrial ecosystems. The Mesozoic lasted from 245 to 65 million years ago, and is divided into three periods. The Mesozoic, which derives its name from the Greek with a rough meaning of middle animals, began after the Permian extinction and ended with the Cretaceous extinction. It comprises the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous Periods. The Mesozoic is most famed for the Dinosaurs, and popular lexicon considers it the Age of the Dinosaurs (or Reptiles). The dinosaurs together with reptiles of all sizes ranging from the gigantic to the merely intimidating by human size standards, dominated the terrestrial environments. The flowering plants, or angiosperms, appeared in the Mesozoic. Importantly, by the end of the Mesozoic, the body plans and corresponding genetic developmental blueprints that define modern life forms were in place, although mammalian avian forms were still quite primitive. The fossil record supports a theory of plate tectonics now widely accepted. ||| Can you tell me more about the fossil records and the theory? ||| This theory is much better at explaining certain geological events and patterns observed in terms of eg mountain ranges and deep ocean trenches. There were features of the Earth's geology and fossil record which could not be explained e.g. Similar fossils of extinct plants and animals were found on opposite sides of the Atlantic Ocean* *It had been suggested that these continents were once linked by land bridges that had sunk, or washed away or just covered in water as the Earth cooled and contracted and sea levels rose. Also, the fact that geographically the continent of Africa seem to fit quite neatly into the shore line of the South America continent. PLATE TECTONICS THEORY: The Earth's lithosphere (the crust and the upper part of the mantle) is cracked into a number of large pieces called tectonic plates, you can think of them as giant rock rafts floating on the 'plastic' mantle. These plates (like big rock rafts) are less dense than the mantle and so float on it and constantly move at relative speeds of a few centimetres per year as a result of convection currents within the Earth's mantle. ||| What was it like during the time dinosaurs were on earth? ||| Dinosaurs Dinosaurs were a group of animals that ruled our world for about 150 million years. They lived during the geologic middle ages of the Earth’s history, in a time that is called the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs were reptiles and belonged to the greatest animals on Earth. The Age of Dinosaurs The Mesozoic era is often called the Age of Dinosaurs. It began about 250 million years ago and ended about 65 million years ago. Geologists divide it into 3 parts:the Triassicthe Jurassicthe Cretaceous During the Mesozoic period the Earth consisted of only one single mass of land. About 200 million years ago this huge continent, Pangaea, broke into many pieces, which started to drift apart. Continents moved slowly into the position they are today. The climate during the Age of Dinosaurs was different than today’s. It was warmer and there was more vegetation. The land was full of swamps, green plains, rivers and lakes. The first forests, mostly conifers that had cones on them emerged. ||| That's really cool. Could such a continent form again? ||| The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of several centimeters per year. Formation of Pangaea Pangaea was not the first supercontinent believed to have existed. From the evidence available, scientists have reconstructed a predecessor, termed Pannotia, that may have formed about 600 mya, before dividing again some 50 million years later. Another, earlier hypothesized supercontinent is Rodinia, believed to have formed approximately 1,100 mya and divided 750 mya. Tentative evidence suggests that the Columbia (supercontinent) existed between 1.8 and 1.5 billion years ago. There is also some evidence for an even earlier supercontinent named Kenorland, existing between ~2.7 billion years to ~2.1 billion years ago, and Earth's possibly first supercontinent named Vaalbara, existing between ~3.3 billion years to ~2.8 billion years ago. Rodinia, believed to have formed 1.1 billion years ago during the Proterozoic, was the supercontinent from which all subsequent continents, sub or super, derived. Paleozoic era (542 - 251 mya)Cambrian Ordovician Silurian Devonian Carboniferous Permian The hypothesized supercontinent Gondwana is believed to have been involved in the formation of Pangaea. ||| Okay. You mentioned three periods in the Dinosaur era. What was characteristic about the first one? ||| It was during the Triassic period that archosaurs (\"\"ruling reptiles\"\"), including dinosaurs, crocodiles, and Pterosaurs first evolved. Prior to the Triassic, during the previous Permian era, mammal-like reptiles had been the dominant land animals. Some survived into the Triassic, but they dramatically declined, apparently out-competed by the dinosaurs. The mammal-like reptiles did however give rise to the first mammals, these being tiny mouse-sized animals. The dominant plants during the Triassic period were conifers, ferns, ginkgos and horsetails. Here is a map of the world during the early Triassic (about 225 million years ago). At this time, all the continents were combined into one massive super-continent, known as Pangaea: The different geography of the world also led to a different climate. On the whole, the Triassic was generally hot and dry, and there was no glaciation or ice caps at the poles (polar regions were moist and temperate). The interior of Pangaea would have had a highly seasonal continental climate, with very hot summers and cold winters. ||| What about the second? ||| The Jurassic Period – 199 to 145.5 million years ago Enter the middle period of the Mesozoic Era. In this period, land was breaking up into separate continents. There were new kinds of forests and all the plants that exist today. Species of dinosaurs had become extinct and new species had appeared. Among them was Dilophosaurus [ image] which is estimated to have existed to about 194 million years ago. It is believed to have been about 20 feet in length and to have weighed about 1,000 pounds. Another species of dinosaur was Brachiosaurus [ image ], one of the biggest land animals yet found. It has been described as having been as tall as 52 feet and as eating herbs, leaves and fruits from the tops of trees. It is described as having existed as long ago as 156 million years and becoming extinct by 145 million years ago. There was also a pigeon-size dinosaur, Epidexipteryx hui, whose remains were discovered in the hills of Inner Mongolia in late 2007. ||| And the last? ||| \"\"The Cretaceous Period – 145.5 to 65.5 million years ago The Cretaceous Period is the last of the three periods of the Mezoaic Era and is described as the last period with non-flying dinosaurs, a period ending 65.5 million years ago. During this period the continents had separated, but Australia and Antarctica were still joined. Each continent had its own flora and fauna. There were now flowering plants such as magnolias and waterlilies. Around 115 million years ago a bird-like creature with wings of skin rather than feathers, a pterosaur, was in the skies over what today is Brazil. It had a wingspan of five meters (16.4 feet) and when standing its shoulders were about one meter (39.37 inches) from the ground. Among the last of the non-flying dinosaurs was Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex as it has been called [ image ]. It is believed to have lived from approximately 68 to 65 million years ago. It was a villain in the science fiction movie Jurassic Park (although it was not of the Jurassic Period.) T-Rex was an aggressive flesh eater. ||| What happened to dinosaurs after then? ||| Most dinosaur species lived and died out during this period, but at the end of the Cretaceous period (65 million years ago), all remaining types of dinosaurs (with the exception of birds which had already evolved, and are widely believed to be descended from dinosaurs) died out. At the same time many other creatures (for example Ammonites , and Belemnites , as well as Pterosaurs , and many large marine reptiles such as Mosasaurs . Plesiosaurs and Pliosaurs ) also became extinct. In fact, all animals weighing more than 55 pounds (25 kilograms) seem to have died out! While are not sure what happened, we do know that something happened at about 65 million years ago. This event shows up as clear boundary in the rocks, known as the \"\"K-T boundary\"\", the extinction event usually being referrred to as the \"\"Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction\"\". Scientists have proposed many different possible explanations for what may have happened, and why this mass extinction might have happened: (Note: Sometimes these suggested explanations are informally called \"\"theories\"\", however in this case \"\"hypotheses\"\" is the correct term, since in science a theory means a well-substantiated explanation of some natural phenomenon or observation, whereas as \"\"hypothesis\"\" means a suggested explanation which needs to be tested against experimental evidence). ||| How do the evolution of dinosaurs across the three periods compare? ||| But the fact is that dinosaur diversity reached its peak in the ensuing Cretaceous period. Geography and Climate During the Jurrasic Period The Jurassic period witnessed the breakup of the Pangaean supercontinent into two big pieces, Gondwana in the south (corresponding to modern-day Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica) and Laurasia in the north (Eurasia and North America). At about the same time, intra-continental lakes and rivers formed that opened new evolutionary niches for aquatic and terrestrial life. The climate was hot and humid, with steady rainfall, ideal conditions for the explosive spread of lush, green plants. Terrestrial Life During the Jurassic Period Dinosaurs: During the Jurassic period, relatives of the small, quadrupedal, plant-eating prosauropods of the Triassic period gradually evolved into multi-ton sauropods like Brachiosaurus and Diplodocus. This period also saw the concurrent rise of medium- to large-sized theropod dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Megalosaurus. This helps explain the evolution of the earliest, armor-bearing ankylosaurs and stegosaurs. Mammals: The mouse-sized early mammals of the Jurassic period, only recently evolved from their Triassic ancestors, kept a low profile, scurrying around at night or nesting high up in trees so as not to get squashed under the feet of bigger dinosaurs. ||| That's interesting.

The weather, food and amenities were all perfect. The only problem is that a lot of people had the same idea. August being the height of the high season, we predictably had to battle our way through hordes of fellow tourists. Yet not even overcrowding (or the political chaos in Rome) can spoil Bella Italia. You can easily get punch-drunk on its splendors, from Bernini’s sublime statues to the Amalfi Coast’s majestic cliffs.

What’s that? ||| A duomo is an Italian word for a cathedral, or a Catholic church where the bishop is located. All cathedrals, including the Duomo Cathedral of Florence, are designed with four perpendicular arms so that the entire building has the shape of a cross, symbolizing the crucifixion of Christ. The long arms running from west to east are called the nave, and the shorter ones from north to south are the transept. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing. Historical Background During the time when the Duomo was built, Italy was full of city-states, or cities operating as independent governments, that were building up new wealth from international trade. As such, they were constantly competing with each other. Sometimes this meant war, but usually the competitions were simply designed to embarrass the other or prove that one city was the richest and most powerful in the area. One popular way to do this was by constructing massive buildings that required lots of money, manpower, and technological innovation. ||| Cool!  What kinds of innovations?\n",

Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternatives for dispensing the water are a garden hose, soaker hose or watering can. Estimate how much rainwater you'll capture. Collection rates vary depending on the slope and size of the roof, but for estimation purposes, during a 1-inch rainfall you can collect a little over half a gallon for each square foot of roof. ||| I live in Seattle and have a big lawn.

How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof). ||| That sounds like a lot of water.

Some cities offer financial incentives for using rainwater for irrigation as a supplement to municipal water. Caution Check for restrictions on rain barrels and rain harvesting in your area. You may need a permit in some locations, or the use of rain barrels may be prohibited or governed by state, local or neighborhood regulations. Rain Barrel Considerations Plan to install the barrel at a downspout near where you need the water. A rain barrel supplies low-pressure water, and the flow rate decreases as the barrel empties. Elevating the barrel improves the flow rate, and some barrels come with a pump to increase water pressure. The increased flow can supply low-pressure drip irrigation, but sprinklers and hose-end sprayers do not work with a rain barrel. Your other alternatives for dispensing the water are a garden hose, soaker hose or watering can. Estimate how much rainwater you'll capture. Collection rates vary depending on the slope and size of the roof, but for estimation purposes, during a 1-inch rainfall you can collect a little over half a gallon for each square foot of roof. ||| I live in Seattle and have a big lawn.

How much rain water can I catch? The Puget Sound averages about three feet of rain per year, but two thirds of it falls from November to March. Most areas in the region average less than two inches total rainfall for July and August. To determine the amount of rain your roof catches, multiply your home’s width by its length (in feet) to estimate its footprint. Then estimate the portion of this area that drains to the downspout you’ll be using to catch your rain. This formula will give a rough estimate of how much rain you can catch: Rain caught (gallons) = (inches of rain) x 0.6* x (portion of building footprint). *One inch of rain falling on a square foot of surface yields approximately 0.6 gallons of water. For example, if your home’s footprint is 1,400 square feet, and you want to know the amount of water that comes from a ¼ inch (.25”) rain event: Rain caught (gallons) = (.25) x (.6) x (1,400) = 210 gallons (or less if you’re only gathering from one part of the roof). ||| That sounds like a lot of water.

      "What’s the science behind why we drink alcohol? ||| By jacking up dopamine levels in your brain, alcohol tricks you into thinking that it’s actually making you feel great (or maybe just better, if you are drinking to get over something emotionally difficult). The effect is that you keep drinking to get more dopamine release, but at the same time you’re altering other brain chemicals that are enhancing feelings of depression. Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent.

Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. ||| Who is at high risk?\n",

These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. ||| What is a safe amount to drink daily?\n",

Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. ||| What are the causes of it? ||| This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. ||| Who is at high risk? ||| Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction. These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. ||| What is a safe amount to drink daily? ||| A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. ||| What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why?\n",

That’s the simple, surprising conclusion of a massive study, co-written by 512 researchers from 243 institutions, published Thursday in the prestigious journal the Lancet. The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you.

Research suggests that alcohol’s affect on dopamine is more significant for men than women, which may account for men drinking more than women on average. According to results from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), alcoholism affects men more than women: About 10 percent of men, compared to 3 to 5 percent of women, become alcoholics over the course of their lifetime. Over time, with more drinking, the dopamine effect diminishes until it’s almost nonexistent. But at this stage, a drinker is often “hooked” on the feeling of dopamine release in the reward center, even though they’re no longer getting it. ||| What are the causes of it? ||| This creates further withdrawal, leading to a physical dependency -- the addict needs to use more of the substance just to feel normal, creating a vicious cycle that can be difficult to break. Because of this learning process and eventual physical dependence on a substance, the substance user becomes a substance abuser. As a result, the abuser loses control over the act of taking a substance or engaging in an activity. This has led to the idea that in order to cure an addiction, abstinence -- total discontinuation of substance use or behavior -- is necessary. Under the disease model of addiction, the brain's motivational center becomes reorganized. The priorities are shuffled so that finding and using the substance (or another substance that will produce similar effects) becomes top priority as far as the brain is concerned. In this sense, the drug has essentially taken over the brain, and the addict is no longer in control of his behavior. An alcoholic won't, for example, have trouble deciding whether or not to get in his car and drive to the store to get more alcohol -- the urge will be irresistible. ||| Who is at high risk? ||| Aside from genetic factors, which account for about 50 percent of the risk of addiction as shown by twin studies, external factors also put teens at a greater risk for developing alcoholism or drug addiction. These include stress at school or at home and difficulty with interpersonal relationships, among others. And the fact that the teenage brain is developmentally different from that of an adult needs to be considered as well, say experts.“We have become more aware of the developing nature of the adolescent brain, particularly the frontal lobe areas of the brain, which are involved in decision-making and risk-taking behaviors, and how this affects teenagers’ behaviors and choices,” says James Garbutt, MD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a research scientist at the Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. “There is a major difference in how alcoholism and drug addiction affects teens compared to adults.”Teen Drug Addiction: At a Greater Danger Than Adults A recent study done at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) documented brain development patterns in children and teens from ages 5 to 20. ||| What is a safe amount to drink daily? ||| A sweeping international study of alcohol consumption has found no overall health benefits from moderate drinking and calls into question the U.S. guidelines that say men can safely drink twice as much as women. The threshold for low-risk drinking, the researchers found, is about seven beers a week for men and women alike. The new report, published Thursday in the Lancet and boasting 120 co-authors, aggregated data from multiple studies of drinking patterns and health outcomes among nearly 600,000 people in 19 high-income countries. Strikingly, the data did not show a significant difference between men and women in the amount of alcohol that can be consumed without a drop in life expectancy. That directly contradicts U.S. government guidelines that define moderate, “low-risk” drinking as two drinks a day for men and one drink for women, with a limit of 14 a week for men and seven for women — with lower levels for people over the age of 65. There’s a transatlantic difference of opinion about drinking limits for men and women. ||| What do the guidelines say for pregnant women? Why? ||| S. Department of Health and Human Services. The Surgeon General first advised women to abstain from alcohol during pregnancy in 1981, and issued a new advisory in 2005. The advisory states in part, “Based on the current, best science available we now know the following: No amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy;Alcohol can damage the embryo or fetus at any stage of pregnancy;Damage can occur in the earliest weeks of pregnancy, even before a woman knows she is pregnant;The cognitive effects and behavioral problems resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure are lifelong.”“For these reasons: A pregnant woman should not drink alcohol during pregnancy;A pregnant woman who has already consumed alcohol during pregnancy should stop in order to minimize further risk;A woman who is considering becoming pregnant should abstain from alcohol.”About half of all pregnancies are unplanned. As a result, many women consume alcohol without knowing that they are pregnant. The Surgeon General’s advisory also suggests that women of childbearing age should consult their physician about how best to reduce the risk of prenatal alcohol exposure. ||| But I’ve heard that pregnant women in France drink wine with dinner. Is that true? ||| \"Why Can't A Pregnant Woman Have A Drink? Margaret Hartmann8/24/10 11:15am 683Many medical experts say it's OK for pregnant woman to have one or two glasses of wine a week, and drinking while pregnant is common in Europe. So why is moderate drinking during pregnancy still taboo in America? While the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists still says that \"\"no amount of alcohol consumption can be considered safe during pregnancy,\"\" the New York Post reports that a 2009 study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology found children whose mothers had one or two drinks per week while pregnant did not have an increased risk of cognitive defects compared to those who had no alcohol. One mom tells the Post that her doctor actually told her to \"\"go home and drink a glass of wine,\"\" after having an amniocentesis test because it would help calm painful uterine contractions after the procedure. This would surprise many American moms, but not Europeans; 2008 study published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research said more than 50 percent of French women drank at least once during their pregnancy, compared to only 12 percent of American women. ||| So you mean that the US suggestion may be too strict? What is the French government's attitude? ||| “You should not drink if you are pregnant, are considering getting pregnant or even if you could possibly get pregnant.”Other countries, like the U. K. and France, that once gave less stringent advice–pregnant women should not exceed 1-2 drinks per week– now state no amount of drinking is safe, and that women who are pregnant or trying to conceive should abstain entirely. At the heart of this debate is the research itself. So, what do we actually know about light drinking during pregnancy? Let’s start with alcohol and the risk of miscarriage. Light drinking, the equivalent of 1-2 drinks per week, during the first trimester, boosts the odds of a first trimester miscarriage by about 30%, and the odds of a early second trimester miscarriage (between 13-16 weeks) by about 70%, according to a large study of over 90,000 pregnancies in Denmark. The risk rose with greater intakes. Drinking 4 or more drinks per week during the first trimester more than doubled the odds of a miscarriage. ||| Tell me about the findings from the Lancet study you mentioned. What advice did it give for safety? ||| To minimize health risks, the optimal amount of alcohol someone should consume is none. That’s the simple, surprising conclusion of a massive study, co-written by 512 researchers from 243 institutions, published Thursday in the prestigious journal the Lancet. The researchers built a database of more than a thousand alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2016. The goal was to estimate how alcohol affects the risk of 23 health problems. The number that jumped out in the end was zero. Anything more than that was associated with health risks. “What has been underappreciated, what’s surprising, is that no amount of drinking is good for you,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of global health at the University of Washington and the senior author of the report. “People should no longer think that a drink or two a day is good for you. What’s best for you is to not drink at all,” she said. ||| I’d like to stop. What are some treatment options? ||| Page contents Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)Varenicline (Champix)Bupropion (Zyban)E-cigarettes If you want to stop smoking, several different treatments are available from shops, pharmacies and on prescription to help you beat your addiction and reduce withdrawal symptoms. The best treatment for you will depend on your personal preference, your age, whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding and any medical conditions you have. Speak to your GP or an NHS stop smoking adviser for advice. Research has shown that all these methods can be effective. Importantly, evidence shows that they are most effective if used alongside support from an NHS stop smoking service. The treatments available are outlined below. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)The main reason that people smoke is because they are addicted to nicotine. NRT is a medication that provides you with a low level of nicotine, without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals present in tobacco smoke. It can help reduce unpleasant withdrawal effects, such as bad moods and cravings, which may occur when you stop smoking. ||| No, I meant drinking alcohol.

They suggest that: Depression is associated with a catecholamine deficiency in the brain Mania is associated with a catecholamine excess in the brain This proved to be a very fruitful theory because it was put forward at a time when there was an explosion in our knowlegde about where neurotransmitters were located in the brain, and the discovery of chemicals that interfered with the manufacture and actions of various neurotransmitters in the brain.

Nearly 8 percent of people over 12 suffer from depression, according to the Centers for Disease Control, while the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) states that anxiety disorders affect more than 18 percent of adults. While these two types of disorders are very different on the surface, there are a number of similarities between them that can make it difficult to distinguish between the two without a deeper knowledge of how each disorder manifests. At the same time, many people will experience both disorders at the same time. The following comparison helps to illuminate the similarities and differences between depression and anxiety.

      "What are the mechanisms of depression? ||| The major neurotransmitters are acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin. Many experts believe that an imbalance among the different neurotransmitters is the cause of depression. Although the exact mechanism of action of trazodone is unknown, it probably improves symptoms of depression by inhibiting the uptake of serotonin by nerves in the brain. This results in more serotonin to stimulate other nerves. Trazodone also may increase directly the action of serotonin. ||| What is the role of serotonin? ||| Techniques For Anxiety The Role of Serotonin When it comes to biological factors for depression, it is commonly accepted that serotonin plays a crucial role. In the brain, this neurotransmitter acts as a relay, transporting messages from one area to another. Given this critical task, an imbalance in serotonin levels may influence our emotions. Since depression is often characterized by negative emotions, the link between this mood disorder and serotonin is obvious. Happiness Hormones Other chemicals that play a crucial role in mood disorders are dopamine and endorphins. ||| How can I balance it? ||| But you can create your own dopamine rewards by setting a goal, then take small steps toward it every day. This can be starting a new exercise program, learning French, or challenging yourself to drive home from work a different way every day, preferably without the use of your GPS. According to Dr. Graziano Breuning, working on a goal without fail for 45 days will train your brain to stimulate dopamine production in a new way. Dopamine and Mental Conditions Dopamine plays such an important role in how we live our lives, it’s no surprise that when the dopamine system is out of balance it can contribute to many mental conditions. ( 35)Here are three of the most common conditions that have a dopamine connection. ||| What foods boost it? ||| So the way to increase central nervous system neurotransmitter levels is to provide proper amounts of the amino acid precursor. Bananas, especially ripe bananas, are an exceptional food for regulating dopamine because they have a high concentration of tyrosine. Other foods that increase dopamine through the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine include almonds, apples, watermelons, cherries, yogurt, beans, eggs and meats. It is important to note that dopamine foods alone generally do not have the therapeutic amino acid levels necessary to boost dopamine levels for someone experiencing major depressive disorder. To boost your levels of dopamine, dopamine rich foods may not be adequate. ||| How does the phenylalanine convert to tyrosine? ||| Tyrosine is created from phenylalanine by hydroxylation by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Tyrosine is also ingested directly from dietary protein. Catecholamine-secreting cells use several reactions to convert tyrosine serially to -DOPA and then to dopamine. Depending on the cell type, dopamine may be further converted to norepinephrine or even further converted to epinephrine. Various stimulant drugs (such as a number of substituted amphetamines) are catecholamine analogues. Section::::Structure. Catecholamines have the distinct structure of a benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups, an intermediate ethyl chain, and a terminal amine group. Phenylethanolamines such as norepinephrine have a hydroxyl group on the ethyl chain. ||| Can these drugs alleviate depression? ||| Predictions from the Catecholamine Theory of Mood The catecholamine theory makes the following predictions: Drugs wich destroy CAs should produce depression Drugs which increase CAs should alleviate depression Drugs used to test the Catecholamine Theory of Mood You now have a body of knowledge that can be used to test the catecholamine theory of mood.

The diagnosis of either will then fall into a category and a subcategory. What follows is a list of Common Mood Disorders: Depressive Disorders Major depressive disorders are on our list of mood disorders and are subcategorized into a single episode or recurrent episodes, in which two or more depressive episodes occur. The core symptoms of depression include: Sadness, apathy, unhappiness, apathy, anxiety. Pessimism, guilt, negative thinking, low motivation, poor concentration, suicidal thoughts. Lack of interest in personal appearance and hygiene, agitation, sluggish movements. Changes in appetite, constipation, loss of sex drive, sleep disturbances, menstrual cycle disruption. Manic Disorders The core symptoms of mania include: Elation, grandiosity, irritability. Pressure of thoughts, easily distractible with flighty ideas and poor judgement. Overactive speech.

Johnny Bench, simply put, is the greatest catcher in baseball history. Yogi Berra, Roy Campanella and Pudge Rodriguez fans will disagree, but I have seen them all play. Bench was Rookie of the Year in 1968. In 1970 at age 22, he led the Big Red Machine with 45 home runs and franchise record 148 RBIs while catching 158 games for League MVP. He was MVP again in 1972 when his production dropped to 40 home runs and only 125 RBIs. Bench was a 10-time Gold Glover and 14-time All Star. Bench caught 100 or more games for a record-setting 13 consecutive seasons. Bench hit 389 career home runs. In this new age of Sabermetrics Johnny Bench has the highest WAR (Wins Above Replacement for position players) for any catcher in history. ||| What was he known for? ||| \"He was the highest-ranking catcher. Bench was also elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team as the top vote-receiving catcher. As part of the Golden Anniversary of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award, Bench was selected to the All-Time Rawlings Gold Glove Team. Starting with the 2000 college baseball season, the best collegiate catcher annually receives the Johnny Bench Award. Notable winners include Buster Posey of Florida State University, Kelly Shoppach of Baylor University, Ryan Garko of Stanford University, and Kurt Suzuki of Cal State Fullerton. In 2008, Bench co-wrote the book \"Catch Every Ball: How to Handle Life's Pitches\" with Paul Daugherty, published by Orange Frazer Press. An autobiography published in 1979 called \"Catch You Later\" was co-authored with William Brashler. Bench has also broadcast games on television and radio, and is an avid golfer, having played in several Champions Tour tournaments. In a September 2008 interview with Heidi Watney of the New England Sports Network, Johnny Bench, who was watching a Cleveland Indians/Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park, did an impression of late Chicago Cubs announcer Harry Caray after Red Sox third baseman Kevin Youkilis, a native of Cincinnati, made a tough play.” ||| Who won his award? ||| Johnny Bench Johnny Lee Bench (born December 7, 1947) is an American former professional baseball catcher who played in the Major Leagues for the Cincinnati Reds from 1967 to 1983 and is a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

While Johnny is one of the most famous athletes in Cincinnati history and one of the most acclaimed athletes in American history, period, he could not care less that Bobby will never be another Johnny Bench. Athletically speaking, that is. “Bobby is just a fine young man,” Johnny said recently. “I couldn’t be prouder of him.” Bobby, who is 6-foot-7 and weighs 225 pounds, played some baseball when younger. Bobby said he got some of his height from his mother, Laura, who is tall at 6-foot. (Johnny is 6-1). Bobby mostly played first base in baseball. He was a decent athlete but, as a baseball player, was no Johnny Bench. Who could be?

Heat pumps come with a promise of long term service, and are also cheaper when compared to other heating devices. Certain heat pumps are eco-friendly too. In order to use a furnace in your household, you need certain components, like a thermostat, blowers and burners. One of the plus points of a furnace is that it can provide heat by burning various sources, like gas, oil, wood, electricity and coal. Moreover, the blowers and burners make sure that the furnace works for a longer time. Current age thermostats are now digitalized, and hence, you can now control the temperatures of your household efficiently; thereby reducing your electricity bills and fuel costs. In summary, heat pumps prove to be a better choice when compared to furnaces. The following are the major differences between a heat pump and a furnace:1. A heat pump can either increase or lower temperatures, however a furnace can only provide heat.2. Even though one might opt for a furnace, purchasing a heat pump might be necessary if the temperatures are soaring high.3.

How much does it cost to install one? ||| Installing a heat pump can make a huge difference in your electricity bill by decreasing the cost of heating and cooling your home. A heat pump will replace both the furnace and air conditioner/central air unit. The average cost to install a heat pump ranges from $3,997 and $6,879 depending on the size of your home and type of heat pump. Since a geothermal heat pump requires underground installation, its installation costs will be more expensive than the costs for the air-source type. Though the cost of the heat pump and labor fees may be a significant investment, it can drastically reduce your energy consumption. Consider the following factors before installing a heat pump: On This Page: Heat Pump Installation Cost Considerations Heat Pump Prices Types of Heat Pumps How Does a Heat Pump Work?

What makes it so efficient? ||| It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium. ||| Cool science.

But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones. ||| If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. ||| Tell me about AC systems.\n",

The current federal incentive is limited to the standard $300 tax credit for Energy Star HVAC installations. (Canadians retrofitting an existing home with geothermal qualify for a $3,500 federal grant.) Some forward-thinking utilities have offered low-interest loans to homeowners willing to adopt the technology. \"\"It's a win-win arrangement,\"\" says Steve Rosenstock, energy solutions manager at the Edison Electric Institute, an association of utilities. ||| That’s great. What makes it so efficient? ||| It does this through long loops of underground pipes filled with liquid (water or an antifreeze solution). The loops are hooked up to a geothermal heat pump in your home, which acts as both a furnace and an air conditioner. During the heating season, the liquid pulls heat from the ground and delivers it to the geothermal heating and cooling unit and then to refrigerant coils, where the heat is distributed through a forced-air or hydronic system. During the cooling season, the process runs in reverse. The pump removes heat from your house and transfers it to the earth. Many units can provide domestic hot water as well. A geothermal heat pump is vastly more efficient than conventional heating systems because it doesn’t burn fuel to create warmth; it simply moves existing heat from one place to another. And because temperatures underground remain a relatively constant 50 degrees F year round, the system requires a lot less energy to cool your home than conventional AC systems or air-source heat pumps, which use outside air as a transfer medium. ||| Cool science. But I’ve heard some horror stories about air-source ones. ||| If a conventional air source heat pump is used in colder climates, the system needs an auxiliary source of heat to supplement the heat pump in the event of extremely cold temperatures or when it is simply too cold for the heat pump to work at all. BULLET::::- An Auxiliary Heat/Emergency Heat system, for example a traditional furnace, is also important if the heat pump is malfunctioning or being repaired. In colder climates, split-system heat pumps matched with gas, oil or pellet fuel furnaces will work even in extremely cold temperatures. Section::::Controversy. Units charged with HFC refrigerants are often marketed as low energy or a sustainable technology, however if the HFC leaks out from the system, there is potential to contribute to global warming, as measured in global warming potential (GWP) and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Recent government mandates have seen the phase-out of R-22 refrigerant and its replacement with more environmentally sound R-410A refrigerant. Section::::Impact on electric utilities. While heat pumps with backup systems other than electrical resistance heating are often encouraged by electric utilities, air source heat pumps are a concern for winter-peaking utilities if electrical resistance heating is used as the supplemental or replacement heat source when the temperature drops below the point that the heat pump can meet all of the home's heat requirement. ||| Tell me about AC systems. ||| An AC system has many components: compressor, condenser, receiver dryer, evaporator, and hoses. The compressor, the “heart” of the car’s air conditioning system works like a pump taking refrigerant, (R-12 in older cars, R-134a in 1995 and newer cars) and pressurizing it, passing it along to the evaporator. The AC compressor has several moving parts (including pistons and valves). These internal parts can fail, causing the AC compressor to stop working. It is common for the internal parts of the compressor to come apart and disperse metallic debris throughout the system. Consequently, it is a requirement to replace the orifice tube and the receiver dryer when replacing the compressor since some of the debris may have ended up there. For an AC compressor to work, it needs a clutch, bearing, and an electrical connector. The clutch is driven by a drive/serpentine belt, which engages the compressor when you switch on the AC. The clutch can burn or the bearing can fail. If the bearing or clutch have failed, it is recommended that the compressor be replaced. ||| How is it different from a heat pump?\n",

It is energy contained in raw fuels, and other forms of energy received as input to a system. Primary energy can be non-renewable or renewable. Total primary energy supply ( TPES) is a term used to indicate the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes. [2]The concept of primary energy is used in energy statistics in the compilation of energy balances, as well as in the field of energetics. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of energy carriers used by human society. [3]Secondary energy is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source. The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply. [ citation needed]PE and TPES are better defined in the context of worldwide energy supply.

Primary energy sources are transformed in energy conversion processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as electrical energy, refined fuels, or synthetic fuels such as hydrogen fuel. In the field of energetics, these forms are called energy carriers and correspond to the concept of \"\"secondary energy\"\" in energy statistics. Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy) [ edit]Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. District heating is another example of secondary energy. [5]According to the laws of thermodynamics, primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers. [3]Conversion efficiency varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by Carnot\\'s theorem, and generates a lot of waste heat. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind\\'s energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the exergy of a system. Site and source energy [ edit]Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills. [6]Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion. [7] While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements. [6] For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy. [8] However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from Energy STAR. [9]Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U. S Energy Information Administration, for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews [10] but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey [11] and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey. [12] The US Environmental Protection Agency \\'s Energy STAR program recommends using source energy, [13] and the US Department of Energy uses site energy in its definition of a zero net energy building. [14]Outlook [ edit]Primary energy outlook. Projected from 2007 ( EIA, 2010)Energy accidents and fatalities [ edit]Main article: Energy accidents Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution. Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion k Wh. [15]See also [ edit]Energy portal Energy and society Energy development Energy mix Energy system Future energy development Notes [ edit]^ At the scale of earth sciences, all primary energy sources can be considered to be renewable. The non-renewable essence of resources (PES) is due to the scale of needs within human society. In certain situations, the use of resources by human society is performed at a much higher rate than the minimum rate at which it can be geophysically renewed. This is the rationale behind the differentiation between non-renewable primary energy sources (oil, coal, gas, uranium) and renewable primary energy sources (wind, solar, hydro).^ Some nuclear fuels, such as plutonium or depleted uranium, are also used in nuclear fission power plants. However, they cannot be considered to be primary energy sources as they cannot be found in nature in any quantity. Indeed, there must be a consumption of natural uranium (primary energy source) in order to make these other nuclear fuels available.

Objects can have both kinetic energy and potential energy at the same time. An object can be elevated above the ground (have potential energy) and be moving at the same time (and also have kinetic energy). A baseball, a plane, a flying bird are all simple examples of this.

What is kinetic energy? How can one know if an object has kinetic energy? Which of the following variations will increase the kinetic energy of an object? The kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The amount of kinetic energy ( KE) possessed by an object depends upon its mass ( m) and its velocity ( v ). The formula for calculating the kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 • m • v 2The formula for kinetic energy is stated in the Formula Fix section above. As expressed by the equation, kinetic energy depends upon the mass and the velocity. Any increase in these two quantities will lead to an increase in the amount of kinetic energy possessed by the object. Many students become confused by height, speed, and kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is simply the energy of motion. The faster that an object moves, the greater its kinetic energy. Often times (but certainly not always) a decrease in height will correspond to an increase in speed and a subsequent increase in kinetic energy. But don't be fooled! This is not always the case. It is possible for an object to decrease its height at a constant speed - for instance, when climbing down a flight of stairs or descending on an elevator. What variables would effect the kinetic energy possessed by an object? An object has a kinetic energy of 32 J. If the object's speed is doubled, then its new kinetic energy will be ____ J. (Note: the doubled seen in this question is randomly generated; the actual factor by which speed is changed may differ for your question. )The kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The amount of kinetic energy ( KE) possessed by an object depends upon its mass ( m) and its velocity ( v ). The formula for calculating the kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 • m • v 2The formula for kinetic energy is stated in the Formula Fix section above. The amount of kinetic energy possessed by an object depends directly upon the square of speed (or velocity). An increase in speed will increase the kinetic energy. In fact, an increase in the speed by a factor of 2 will increase the kinetic energy by a factor of 2 2 or 4. How does an alteration in speed effect an object's kinetic energy? What variables would effect the kinetic energy possessed by an object? A 5-kg object is moving with a speed of 4 m/s at a height of 2 m. The kinetic energy of the object is approximately ____ J. The kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. The amount of kinetic energy ( KE) possessed by an object depends upon its mass ( m) and its velocity ( v ). The formula for calculating the kinetic energy is KE = 0.5 • m • v 2This is a straightforward calculation of kinetic energy from mass and speed. There are two common mistakes which students are prone to make. First, there is the mistake of forgetting to multiply by 0.5 (or dividing by 2). Second, there is the mistake of forgetting to square the speed. How does one calculate the kinetic energy of an object? An object will definitely have potential energy if it is _____. Definition of Potential Energy: Potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its position.

An object can be moving (have kinetic energy) and be elevated above the ground at the same time (and also have potential energy). A baseball, a plane, a flying bird are all simple examples of this. In order to have potential energy, the object simply has to have a nonzero height. How can one know if an object has potential energy? What is potential energy?

Which of the following variations will increase the potential energy of an object? The potential energy is the energy stored in an object due to its vertical position above (or below) the ground or some zero level. The amount of potential energy ( PE) possessed by an object depends upon its mass ( m) and its height ( h ). The formula for calculating the potential energy is PE = m • g • hwhere g is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s/s on Earth)The formula for potential energy is stated in the Formula Fix section above. As expressed by the equation, potential energy depends upon the mass and the height of the object. Any increase in these two quantities will lead to an increase in the amount of potential energy possessed by the object. Many students become confused by height, speed, and potential energy. Potential energy is simply the energy stored in an object due its vertical position. The higher an object is raised, the more potential energy which it possesses. Often times (but certainly not always) an increase in height corresponds to a decrease in speed. So some gain the impression that a decrease in speed will always lead to an increase in height. But don't be fooled! This type of thinking is not correct. First, it puts the cart before the horse (or the effect before the cause). It is an increase in the height that causes the decrease in speed (when they do correspond to each other). And second, it is simply not always true that the change in height leads to a change in speed. It is possible for an object to decrease its height at a constant speed - for instance, when climbing down a flight of stairs or descending on an elevator. In the end, the only two variables which can be used to evaluate whether or not the potential energy has increased are the variables of mass and height. What variables would effect the potential energy possessed by an object? A 5-kg object is moving with a speed of 4 m/s at a height of 2 m. The potential energy of the object is approximately ____ J.

The formula for calculating the potential energy is PE = m • g • hwhere g is the acceleration of gravity (9.8 m/s/s on Earth)This is a straightforward calculation of potential energy from mass and height. Of course the speed value which is stated has nothing to do with the potential energy calculation. To be approximate (and arrive at the answer more quickly), use the approximation that g is 10 m/s/s.

Process energy requirements and gross energy requirements13. Examples of calculations of energy conversions1. Introduction Energy is involved in all life cycles, and it is essential in agriculture as much as in all other productive activities. An elementary food chain already shows the need for energy: crops need energy From solar radiation to grow, harvesting needs energy from the human body in work, and cooking needs energy from biomass in a fire. The food, in its turn, provides the human body with energy. Intensifying food production for higher output per hectare, and any other advancement in agricultural production, imply additional operations which all require energy. For instance: land preparation and cultivation, fertilising, irrigation, transport, and processing of crops. In order to support these operations, tools and equipment are used, the production of which also requires energy (in sawmills, metallurgical processes, workshops and factories, etc.). Major changes in agriculture, like mechanisation and what is called the \"\"green revolution\"\", imply major changes with respect to energy. Mechanisation means a change of energy sources, and often a net increase of the use of energy. The green revolution has provided us with high yield varieties. But these could also be called low residue varieties (i.e. per unit of crop). And it is exactly the residue which matters as an energy source for large groups of rural populations. Other sectors of rural life require energy as well. The provision of shelter, space heating, water lifting, and the construction of roads, schools and hospitals, are examples. Furthermore, social life needs energy for lighting, entertainment, communication, etc. We observe that development often implies additional energy, and also different forms of energy, like electricity. Energy is a scarce resource, at least for some groups of people in some places and, maybe, for the world as a whole. A rational use of energy is then necessary for economic and environmental reasons. This applies to agriculture as much as to any other sector of the economy. A key to the rational use of energy is the understanding of the role of energy. The following sections aim to help understand energy in agriculture and rural development. It should help communication between agricultural planners and energy specialists. Anyone familiar with energy concepts should skip this chapter and read immediately Chapter 2.2. Forms of energy Energy can exist in various forms. Examples are:- Radiation energy: the radiation from the sun contains energy, and also the radiation from a light or a fire. More solar energy is available when the radiation is more intense and when it is collected over a larger area. Light is the visible part of radiation;- Chemical energy: wood and oil contain energy in a chemical form. The same is true for all other material that can burn. The content of chemical energy is larger the larger the heating value (calorific value) of the material is and, of course, the more material we have. Also animate energy (delivered by bodies of human beings and animals) is, in essence, chemical energy. Furthermore, batteries contain chemical energy;- Potential energy: this is, for example, the energy of a water reservoir at a certain height. The water has the potential to fall, and therefore contains a certain amount of energy. More potential energy is available when there is more water and when it is at a higher height;- Kinetic energy: this is energy of movement, as in wind or in a water stream. The faster the stream flows and the more water it has, the more energy it can deliver. Similarly, more wind energy is available at higher windspeeds, and more of it can be tapped by bigger windmill rotors;- Thermal energy or heat: this is indicated by temperature. The higher the temperature, the more energy is present in the form of heat. Also, a larger body contains more heat;- Mechanical energy, or rotational energy, also called shaft power: this is the energy of a rotating shaft. The amount of energy available depends on the flywheel of the shaft, i.e.:. on the power which makes the shaft rotate;- Electrical energy: a dynamo or generator and a battery can deliver electrical energy. The higher the voltage and the current, the more electrical energy is made available. Note that sometimes by \"\"energy form\"\" an energy source (cf. section 5), or even a particular fuel (like oil or coal), is meant.3. Energy conversion\"\"Utilising\"\" energy always means converting energy from one form into another. For instance, in space heating, we utilise energy, that is, we convert chemical energy of wood into heat. Or, in lift irrigation, a diesel engine converts chemical energy of oil into mechanical energy for powering the shaft of a pump which, in its turn, converts shaft power into potential energy of water (i.e. bringing the water to a higher height). \"\"Generating\"\" energy also means converting energy from one form into another. We can say that a diesel engine generates energy, which means that the engine converts chemical energy of oil into mechanical energy. Also, a wind turbine generates energy, which means it converts kinetic energy from wind into mechanical energy. And a solar photovoltaic cell generates energy by converting radiation energy into electricity. The generation of energy, in fact, deals with a source of energy, whereas the utilisation of energy serves an end-use of energy. In between, the energy can flow through a number of conversion steps. The words \"\"generation\"\" and \"\"utilisation\"\" are a little confusing because, in fact, no energy can be created or destroyed. All we can do is transform or convert energy from one form into another. In generating energy, we make energy available from a source, by converting it into another form. In utilising energy, we also convert energy, often from some intermediate form into a useful form. In all conversions, we find that part of the energy is lost. This does not mean that it is destroyed, but rather that it is lost for our purposes, through dissipation in the form of heat or otherwise (cf. figure 1). Figure 1. Energy conversion Energy conversions can take place from any one form of energy into almost any other form of energy. (Some conversions have no practical value.) Which conversion is desired depends on our purposes. For instance, for power generation, we convert potential energy from hydro resources into mechanical energy, whereas, in water pumping for lift irrigation, we do the reverse. And, with photovoltaic cells, we convert radiation energy into electricity, whereas with light bulbs we do the reverse. Table 5 in section 9 gives examples of conversions and some typical efficiencies of energy converters. Section 13 shows some calculations of energy conversions.4. Energy and power Energy and power are related but totally different concepts. A tank of petrol contains a certain amount of energy. We can combust this petrol in a certain time period, that is, we convert the energy of the petrol into mechanical energy, perhaps to power a car. The power is the energy produced per unit of time. The combustion process can be fast or slow. In the case of faster combustion, more power is produced. Obviously, the tank will be empty sooner in the case of high power production than in the case of low power production. If power is energy per time unit, then energy is power multiplied by time period. For Instance, if an oxen delivers a certain amount of power, then after a certain time period it will have delivered a cerain amount of energy, i.e. the power times the time period. The same principle applies to all other energy conversions, whether for energy generation or for energy utilisation. This implies that we characterise energy resources in units of energy (the amount of energy they contain), and energy conversion devices in units of power (the amount of power they can produce or consume). A closer look at the list of forms of energy in section 2 reveals that some of them have actually been described in terms of power (radiation, kinetic, mechanical and electrical energy). They become energy quantities when we specify the time period during which the power is delivered, and multiply the power by this time period. Also in section 2, the quantities of chemical, potential and thermal energy become power quantities when we divide them by a time period during which the energy quantity is being converted.5. Energy sources Energy sources partly correspond to the energy forms of section 2, but not entirely. The following energy sources can be relevant for rural areas.- Biomass. We distinguish between: woody biomass (stems, branches, shrubs, hedges, twigs), non-woody biomass (stalks, leaves, grass, etc. ), and crop residues (bagasse, husks, stalks, shells, cobs, etc.). The energy is converted through combustion (burning), gasification (transformation into gas) or anaerobic digestion (biogas production). Combustion and gasification ideally require dry biomass, whereas anaerobic digestion can very well take wet biomass. Fuel preparations can include chopping, mixing, drying, carbonising (i.e. charcoal making) and briqueting (i.e. densification of residues of crops and other biomass).- Dung from animals, and human excreta. The energy is converted through direct combustion or through anaerobic digestion.- Animate energy. This is the energy which can be delivered by human beings and animals by doing work.- Solar radiation, i.e. energy from the sun. We distinguish between direct beam radiation and diffuse (reflected) radiation. Direct radiation is only collected when the collector faces the sun. Diffuse radiation is less intense, but comes from all directions, and is also present on a cloudy day. Solar energy can be converted through thermal solar devices (generating heat) or through photovoltaic cells (generating electricity). Direct beam solar devices (whether thermal or photovoltaic) would need a tracking mechanism to have the device continuously facing the sun.- Hydro resources, i.e. energy from water reservoirs and streams. We distinguish between: lakes with storage dams, natural heads (waterfalls), weirs, and run-of-river systems. Hydro energy can be converted by waterwheels or hydro turbines.- Wind energy, i.e. energy from wind. Wind machines can be designed either for electricity generating or for water lifting (for irrigation and drinking water).- Fossil fuels, like coal, oil and natural gas. Unlike the previous energy sources, the fossil energy sources are non-renewable.- Geothermal energy, that is, the energy contained in the form of heat in the earth. A distinction is made between tectonic plates (in volcanic areas) and geopressed reservoirs (could be anywhere). Geothermal energy is, strictly speaking, non-renewable, but the amount of heat in the earth is so large that for practical reasons geothermal energy is generally ranked with the renewables. Geothermal energy can only be tapped at places where high earth temperatures come close to the earth\\'s surface. This list only contains primary energy sources. These are the energy sources which are present in our natural environment. Secondary energy sources, like batteries, are not included here. We observe that the primary energy sources are not the ultimate sources of energy. For instance, animate energy comes from biomass, whereas biomass energy ultimately comes from the sun. Apart from geothermal and nuclear energy, all our so-called primary energy sources have ultimately got their energy from the sun!Section 10 will discuss methods for comparing the energy content of energy sources.6. Some notes on energy terminology Energy sources are sometimes classified according to characteristics like: renewable, traditional, commercial, etc. The terminology is rather ambiguous, as the meaning of the words often depends on the context. Some connotations are given below. Renewable is generally contrasted with fossil. Renewable are biomass, animate, solar, water and wind energy, as well as geothermal energy. Fossil energy is contained in coal, oil and natural gas. Traditional energy is often contrasted with non-traditional energy, and also with new energy. However, what is considered as traditional depends on what one is used to. In industrialised societies which are used to fossil fuels, renewable energies like biomass and animate energy are often called traditional. At the same time, engineers working on \"\"new\"\" energies like wind or solar energy often consider fossil fuels as traditional. Apparently, what people call traditional are the forms they are actually not used to. New and renewable energy sources are often put together. They exclude fossil and nuclear energy. Commercial energy is contrasted with non-commercial energy, and sometimes with traditional energy. Commercial energy certainly includes energy from fossil fuels which have been monetarized, but also some forms of new and renewable energies which are part of the cash economy. Biomass and some other sources of renewable energy (thermal solar energy) are sometimes considered non-commercial, because they are thought to be freely available. However, in many areas, biomass fuels have to be paid for!7. Energy flow As we have seen, generating and utilising energy means converting energy from one form into another. Often, intermediate steps are Implied. The energy flows through a number of forms, as well as conversion steps, between the source and the end-use. The costs increase accordingly. We distinguish between primary, secondary, final and useful energy. An example is an energy flow which is related to charcoal. Here, the primary energy form is wood. The wood is converted into charcoal in a charcoal kiln. Charcoal is the secondary form of energy, and it is transported to the consumer. What the consumer buys at the market place is charcoal, and this is called final energy. The consumer eventually converts the charcoal into heat for cooking. The heat is the useful energy. Another example of an energy flow is: primary energy in the form of a hydro resource, secondary energy in the form of electricity at the hydro power station, final energy in the form of electricity at a saw mill, and useful energy in the form of shaft power for sawing.energytechnologyexamplesprimarycoal, wood, hydro, dung, oil, etc.conversionpower plant, kiln, refinery, digestersecondaryrefined oil, electricity, biogastransport/transmissiontrucks, pipes, wiresfinaldiesel oil, charcoal, electricity, biogasconversionmotors, heaters, stovesusefulshaft power, heat Energy flow is represented In the diagram in Figure 2. It refers to the following terminology. Primary energy is the energy as it is available in the natural environment, i.e. the primary source of energy. Secondary energy is the energy ready for transport or transmission. Final energy is the energy which the consumer buys or receives. Useful energy is the energy which is an input in an end-use application. Note that useful energy is almost invariably either in the form of heat or in the form of shaft power. For a few end-uses (e.g. communication equipment), electricity is the form of useful energy. Note that in some cases the primary energy is at the same time the secondary, and even the final energy (c.f. wood gathered for cooking purposes, or animate power for pulling). The breakdown of primary to useful energy is relevant, because with each conversion step some energy is lost. In order to reduce costs and avoid unnecessary losses, we will always aim at eliminating unnecessary steps in the flow of energy. Furthermore, the breakdown of energy flows is relevant for surveys and statistics. We may not simply add primary energy with, say, final energy! (cf. section 10.)8. Energy units and dimensions So far, we have discussed energy in qualitative terms. In order to proceed, we must discuss energy quantitatively. That means, we need units for measuring quantities of energy and related concepts. We use the International system of units (SI units), which is based on the dimensions and basic units in Table 1. Table 1. Basic SI unitsdimensionbasic unitsymbollengthmetermmasskilogramkgtime Secondselectric currentampere Atemperaturekelvin°KThe unit of energy in this unit system is joule (J), and the unit of power is watt (W). These and many other units can be derived from the basic SI units. The relationship between some derived SI units and the basic SI units is represented in Table 2. Table 2.

In some countries, or in a particular context, other units than SI units are also used. They can be converted into SI units, which are more convenient for calculations. The conversion of some non-SI units into SI units is given in Table 3, for energy and for power. Table 3.

The following results give us some feeling of magnitudes of energy, as represented in different energy forms.

Energy losses and efficiency As has been stated in Section 3, energy conversions always imply energy losses. This leads us to the concept of efficiency, as follows. A quantity of energy in a certain form is put into a machine or device, for conversion into another form of energy. The output energy in the desired form is only a part of the Input energy. The balance is the energy loss (usually in the form of diffused heat). It means the converter has less than 100% efficiency. The efficiency of an energy converter is now defined as the quantity of energy in the desired form (the output energy) divided by the quantity of energy put in for conversion (the input energy). The efficiency is usually expressed by the Greek letter h . Hence: Table 5 gives some typical efficiencies of energy converters. Table 5. Some typical efficiencies of energy converters Converterform of input energyform of output energyefficiency %petrol enginechemicalmechanical20 - 25diesel enginechemicalmechanical30 - 45electric motorelectricalmechanical80 - 95boiler & turbinethermalmechanical7-40hydraulic pumpmechanicalpotential40 - 80hydro turbinepotentialmechanical70 - 99hydro turbinekineticmechanical30 - 70generatormechanicalelectrical80 - 95batterychemicalelectrical80 - 90solar cellradiationelectrical8-15solar collectorradiationthermal25 - 65electric lampelectricallightca. 5waterpumpmechanicalpotentialca. 60water heaterelectricalthermal90 - 92gas stovechemicalthermal24 - 30In some of these converters, intermediate forms of energy occur between the form of the input energy and the form of the output energy. For instance, with diesel engines, the intermediate form is thermal energy. When thermal energy is Involved either as the input or as an intermediate form, the efficiency is generally low. The energy converter can be a device, or a process, or a whole system. An example of the efficiency of an energy conversion system is given in Table 6. The overall efficiency equals the product of the efficiencies of the various components of the system. We see that it can be very low indeed. Table 6energy formenergy converterefficiencychemical energydiesel engine30%mechanical energygenerator80%electricityelectric motor80%mechanical energywaterpump60%potential energyefficiency of the system = 30% x 80% x 80%x 60% = 12%Efficiency of an energy conversion system: An example Where energy is a scarce resource, we want the efficiency of conversion to be high, in order to save energy. But higher efficiency often implies higher costs for better equipment. Optimisation with respect to, on the one hand, the costs of energy and, on the other hand, the costs of equipment, is a major task in energy planning. The problem of optimization is different when energy sources are free (like with wind, solar and some hydro sources). Energy efficiency has then a limited meaning, and the choice of technology will be guided by the cost effectiveness of the equipment. A very high system efficiency can be obtained when heat losses from one converter are utilised as energy inputs in another. We call this waste heat utilisation. It is applicable, for instance, in agro-processing where heat from Industrial converters is utilised for drying of products. Cogeneration is another example, i.e. the utilisation of \"\"waste\"\" heat from electricity production, for purposes of process heat in Industry.10. Equivalence and replacement of energy forms In principle, the energy content of a fuel is known when the fuel Is specified. For chemical energy, the energy content is given as the calorific value, or heating value, of the fuel. The unit can be MJ/kg. And so we can compare different fuels with different energy contents. We can work out how much of one fuel is equivalent to a quantity of another fuel. For quantifying energy resources, we sometimes use coal as a reference, and the unit for comparison is then ton-of-coal-equivalent (tee). A certain amount of an energy resource is then characterised by its tee. That is, the resource has an energy content equivalent to so many tee. Alternatively, we can express the energy equivalent of a resource in units of ton-of-oil-equivalent (toe), or in barrels-of-oil-equivalent (boe). Table 7 gives the equivalent values of some fuels. Table 7. Energy equivalent values of some fuelsfuelunittonnes of coal equivalenttonnes of oil equivalentbarrels of oil equivalent GJ (*)coaltonne1.000.705.0529.3firewood (**) (airdried)tonne0.460.322.3413.6kerosine (jet fuel)tonne1.471.037.4343.1natural gas1000 m 31.190.836.0034.8gasolinebarrel0.180.120.905.2gasoil/dieselbarrel0.200.141.005.7 (*) Note that GJ/tonne is the same as MJ/kg. (**) Note that the energy equivalent of wood can vary a factor 3 depending on the moisture content of the wood. However, what we can achieve with an amount of energy depends very much on how the energy is utilised, that is, on the efficiencies of the energy converters applied. Efficiencies can vary enormously for different converters, as we have seen in Section 9. The energy equivalent is then of limited use to us. In practice, when comparing sources of energy, we are more interested in the replacement value of the energy form. The latter Indicates how much of that energy form is required to do the same job (i.e. serve the same use) as another energy form or fuel. Again, as a reference, coal is sometimes used. The replacement value of an energy form is, then again, expressed in tee. However, this value will be different from the equivalent value of that energy form. An easy way of comparing replacement values of different energy forms is by indicating how many units of the energy form (or fuel) can replace one kg of coal. We call this the replacement ratio of the fuel. Replacement ratios of some household energy forms compared with coal are given in Table 8, as taken from a particular survey. (Alternatively, a similar table could be made with oil as a reference.) It should be noted that the figures serve as an example only, as they depend on the actual efficiencies of the conversion techniques applied. Table 8.

The coal equivalent of kerosine was 1.47, which means that the heating value of 1 kg kerosine equals that of 1.47 kg coal. However, the coal replacement ratio for a kerosine lamp is 2.10, which means that 2.10 kg coal would be required to get as much light as from 1 kg kerosine. And the coal replacement ratio of a kerosine stove is around 6, which means that 6 kg coal is required to get as much heat in a pot as from 1 kg kerosine. In Section 7, it was mentioned that the breakdown of energy flows is relevant for surveys and statistics. This is illustrated by the previous discussion of energy equivalence and energy replacement. We can add the primary energy resources of a particular region by adding the energy equivalences of all the various primary energy resources available. This will give us a rather theoretical figure, as it does not say what can be done with this amount of energy. We can also add, say, the consumption of final energy for a particular sector in a region, and work this out in a coal replacement value. Or we can consider, say, the amount of useful energy for particular end-uses, and express this in an oil (or coal) replacement value. For working out the replacement values, we should know the conversion methods and their efficiencies which are involved in the energy flow.11. Energy balance An energy balance of a region (or country) is a set of relationships accounting for all energy which is produced, transformed and consumed in a certain period. This basic equation of an energy balance is:source + import = export + variation of stock + use + loss Consider a primary energy balance. Sources are the local (or national) primary energy sources, like coal, hydro, biomass, animate, etc. Imports are energy sources which come from outside the region (or country). Exports go to other regions (or countries). Variations of stock are reductions of stocks (like of forests, coal, etc. ), and storage. Use can be specified sectoral, or by energy form, or by end-use, etc., as required. Losses are technical losses and administrative losses:· technical losses are due to conversions and transport or transmission · administrative losses are due to non-registered consumptions. An energy balance usually refers to a year, and can be made for consecutive years to show time variations. Energy balances can be aggregate, or very detailed, depending on their functions. They can also be elaborate, showing all sorts of structural relationships between energy production and consumption, and specifying various Intermediate forms of energy. An energy balance can also be set up for a village, a household, a farm, or an agricultural unit. It will show the inputs of energy in various forms, the end-use energy, and the losses. Specific for energy balances of agricultural systems is the fact that parts of the outputs of the system are, at the same time, energy Inputs into the system (agricultural residues, dung). Energy balances have to be built up from surveys of what is actually going on. This requires energy resource surveys, and energy consumption surveys, as well as more technical energy audits. Section 12 goes into some aspects of energy auditing. Energy balances provide overviews, which serve as tools for analysing current and projected energy positions. The overviews can he useful for purposes of resource management, or for indicating options in energy saving, or for policies of energy redistribution, etc. However, care must be taken not to single out energy from other economic goods. That means that an energy balance should not be taken as our ultimate guide for action. Energy data are to be translated into economic terms, for a further analysis of options for action. And, of course, socio-cultural and environmental aspects are equally important.12. Process energy requirements and gross energy requirements Energy use in agriculture, or in any other productive system, can be analysed at different levels.1. The direct energy input in the production process and related transport requirements is considered.2. The same as 1., but, in addition, the energy embodied in the materials (e.g. fertiliser) for the production process and related transport is considered.3. The same as 2., but, in addition, the energy required by the machines to produce these materials is considered\\'.4. The same as 3., but, in addition, the energy required by the machine Cools is considered. Etc.... Which level of analysis is relevant for whom? Let us first distinguish: GER = Gross Energy Requirement is the total amount of energy required for a product.e.g. the GER of milk is 5.2 MJ/pint in the U. K. This includes the energy Co produce fertiliser, grow the grass, feed the cows, process the milk in the dairy, and energy for transport. PER = Process Energy Requirement is the energy required for processing the product.e.g. the PER of milk is 0.38 MJ/pint in the U. K. This is the energy required to process the milk in the dairy itself. Generally, when the PER can be lowered, as a result the GER will also be lowered. However, this will not always be the case, and it can also be the reverse. For instance, energy economies of scale can sometimes be achieved at farm level, at the expense of energy requiring investments in Infrastructure or transport facilities. The answer to the question as to which level of analysis is relevant obviously depends oh which policy or management level is involved. For instance, for management at the farm level, it is the PER which matters, and so the first level of analysis is the relevant one. For regional policy makers, however, level 2 is relevant when regional materials and resources are involved. Furthermore, the linkages between the agricultural sector and other sectors will be a concern. For instance, large scale biogas digesters can be an energy efficient option for agro-processing plants, but they may compete with alternative utilisation of the inputs (e.g. dung for poor peoples\\' household fuel). For national policy makers, level 2 or 3 may be relevant. For instance, the establishment of plants for energy intensive goods can be attractive when cheap energy is available (e.g. fertilizer production). The analyses of PER and GER provide data for energy balances. However, these data do not give information on the forms of energy, or time variations (seasonality) in the energy flows, etc. Such information has to be added, as required. PER and GER are part of what is often called energy auditing. This is the monitoring of energy use in productive systems. The analogue in consumption systems is energy end-use analysis. In subsistence agriculture, productive and consumption systems are intertwined, and the two approaches have to be combined in energy surveys.13. Examples of calculations of energy conversions The following examples aim to illustrate methods of calculations, rather than to arrive at accurate numbers. For convenience, the calculations are made in round figures. More exact figures would, anyway, depend on the accuracy of the input data.13.1 How much heat is produced by a human body? A man doing no or very little physical work needs about 2,000 kcal (or less) of energy in his daily food. The body converts this energy almost entirely into heat.1 day = 24 x 60 x 60 s = 86,400 s 1 cal = 4.2 JHence We see that a human body doing no work is equivalent to a heat source of about 100 W - the equivalent of a good bulb.13.2 The power of oil It was said that two teaspoons of diesel oil are equivalent to the work done by a man in a day. Can that be correct? Assume that the power which can be delivered by a man in a day\\'s work is 60 W (cf. example 13.3), and that he can do that for 4 hours per day. So, per day, he delivers:60 W x 4 h = 240 Wh = 240 x 3,600 Ws = 860 k Ws = 860 k J (1)Note: the power of ca. 60 W delivered by doing work is on top of the 100 W produced by the body as heat (cf. example 13.1). The additional power requires additional kcal in the food!We estimate that two teaspoons are equal to 1/50 litre. Diesel oil has an energy content of 42 MJ/kg. For simplicity, we assume that 1 litre of oil weighs 1 kg. Then, 1 litre of oil contains 42 MJ, and 2 teaspoons contain:1/50 x 42 MJ =840 k J (2)Note: the power delivered by a man can be compared with the power which can be delivered by an oxen, which is:0.3 to 1.3 hp = 220 to 960 W. We see that the figures (1) and (2) are approximately the same. So - the comparison was correct!13.3 How can we check that a human body can deliver 60 W during a few hours per day? The actual value could be measured, and it will vary a lot, depending on many factors. One way of checking the order of magnitude is the following. Mountaineers know that a man can climb about 300 metres per hour. Assume that his weight is 75 kg. The gravitational force he is counteracting is then:75 x 9.8 Newton = 750 N The energy delivered by the man in an hour is:300 m x 750 N = 225 k Nm = 225 k J. The power delivered is:13.4 How can we compare the power from oxen with the energy from wood? We cannot compare power and energy. We can make a comparison only if we specify a time period, so as to relate power to energy. For instance, the time period that oxen work. An oxen can deliver typically 0.8 hp. With Table 3 on the conversion of non-SI units, we see that this equals about 740 x 0.8 = 600 W. The amount of energy delivered in one year by this oxen can be calculated if we know how many hours the oxen works in a year. Assume this is 4 hours a day during 300 days, i.e. 1,200 hours per year. One hour is 3,600 s. Hence, the energy from one oxen in a year is:600 x 1,200 x 3,600 Ws = 2,600,000,000 = 2.6 GJThus, 4 oxen would deliver about 10 J in one year. From Table 3 it is seen that this equals roughly the amount of energy in one ton of (wet) wood.13.5 Do we really need more energy under the pot than in the pot? We have seen that a person needs in his food ca. 2,000 kcal per day (cf. example 13.1). This is 8.4 MJ/day for one person. We assume that the food mainly consists of crop products, i.e. biomass. Dry biomass, whether edible or not, has an energy content of typically 18 MJ/kg. The daily energy of 8.4 MJ can thus be delivered by: On a yearly basis, the biomass for food per person is:365 days x 0.5 kg/day = 180 kg/year We can compare this amount with the amount of biomass required as fuel by a household. From surveys, we know that a typical household fuel need for cooking purposes is 500 kg/year of dry biomass per person. Hence This means that roughly 3 times more energy is required under the pot than in the pot!13.6 On the price of rural electricity A consumer in a town centre is charged Rs 0.75 per k Wh for his electricity from the national grid. In a rural area, a consumer has a lamp connected to the local micro hydro unit at a cost of Rs 1 per day. Which consumer pays more for his electricity? Assume that the lamp in the village consumes a power of 40 W and Chat It is switched on for an average of 4 hours per day. This implies an energy consumption of:4 h x 40 W = 160 Wh = 0.16 KWh for 1Rs. The consumer in the town pays for this amount of energy:0.16 x Rs 0.75 = Rs 0.12We see that the villager pays about 8 times more for his electricity than the consumer in the town. References The examples and data in the basic energy concepts are from the International Courses on Rural Energy Planning at Twente University. \"',\n",

       " {'body': '\"This article is about the scalar physical quantity. For other uses, see Energy (disambiguation). Lightning is the electric breakdown of air by strong electric fields and is a flow of energy. The electric potential energy in the atmosphere changes into heat, light and sound which are other forms of energy. In physics, energy (from the Greek ἐνέργεια - energeia, \"\"activity, operation\"\", from ἐνεργός - energos, \"\"active, working\"\" [1]) is a scalar physical quantity that describes the amount of work that can be performed by a force, an attribute of objects and systems that is subject to a conservation law. Eight different forms of energy exist to explain all known natural phenomena. These forms include (but are not limited to) kinetic, potential, thermal, gravitational, sound, light, elastic, and electromagnetic energy. The forms of energy are often named after a related force. Any form of energy can be transformed into another form, but the total energy always remains the same. This principle, the conservation of energy, was first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. According to Noether\\'s theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. [2]Although the total energy of a system does not change with time, its value may depend on the frame of reference. For example, a seated passenger in a moving airplane has zero kinetic energy relative to the airplane, but non-zero kinetic energy relative to the Earth . Contents [ show]History Edit Main article: History of energy The word energy derives from Greek ἐνέργεια ( energeia ), which appears for the first time in the work Nicomachean Ethics [3] of Aristotle in the 4th century BC. In 1021 AD, the Arabian physicist, Alhazen, in the Book of Optics, held light rays to be streams of minute energy particles, stating that \"\"the smallest parts of light\"\" retain \"\"only properties that can be treated by geometry and verified by experiment \"\" and that \"\"they lack all sensible qualities except energy.\"\" [4] In 1121, Al-Khazini, in The Book of the Balance of Wisdom, proposed that the gravitational potential energy of a body varies depending on its distance from the centre of the Earth. [5]The concept of energy emerged out of the idea of vis viva, which Leibniz defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total vis viva was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz claimed that heat consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter — a view shared by Isaac Newton, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. In 1807, Thomas Young was the first to use the term \"\"energy\"\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense. [6] Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \"\" kinetic energy \"\" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term \"\" potential energy .\"\" It was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the caloric) or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum . William Thomson ( Lord Kelvin) amalgamated all of these laws into the laws of thermodynamics, which aided in the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes using the concept of energy by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan . During a 1961 lecture [7] for undergraduate students at the California Institute of Technology, Richard Feynman, a celebrated physics teacher and Nobel Laureate, said this about the concept of energy:“ There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law; it is exact, so far we know. The law is called conservation of energy; it states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity, which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number, and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. ”— The Feynman Lectures on Physics [7]Since 1918 it has been known that the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy, namely time. That is, energy is conserved because the laws of physics do not distinguish between different moments of time (see Noether\\'s theorem ). Energy in various contexts since the beginning of the universe Edit The concept of energy and its transformations is useful in explaining and predicting most natural phenomena. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often described by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations, since in practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces. The concept of energy is widespread in all sciences. In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living process. In an individual organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars) and lipids, which release energy when reacted with oxygen. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) The human equivalent energy indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500k J per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds\\' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts--many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum. [8] The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a “feel” for the use of a given amount of energy [9]In geology, continental drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth\\'s interior. [10] While meteorological phenomena like wind, rain, hail, snow, lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes, are all a result of energy transformations brought about by solar energy on the planet Earth. In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma ray bursts are the universe\\'s highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc. ), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy which has been available since the Big Bang, later being \"\"released\"\" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released which was originally \"\"stored\"\" in heavy isotopes (such as uranium and thorium ), by nucleosynthesis, a process which ultimately uses the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs. In a slower process, heat from nuclear decay of these atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat, which in turn may lift mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the heat energy, which may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store which has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy which has been stored as potential energy in the Earth\\'s gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks; but prior to this, represents energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed stars created these atoms. In another similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy which can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight from our Sun may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. Release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action. Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of ways over time between releases, as more active energy. In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy, including heat. Regarding applications of the concept of energy Edit Energy is subject to a strict global conservation law; that is, whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant. [11]The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified in various ways. For example, it is sometimes convenient to distinguish potential energy (which is a function of coordinates only) from kinetic energy (which is a function of coordinate time derivatives only). It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, electric energy, thermal energy, and other forms. These classifications overlap; for instance thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy. The transfer of energy can take various forms; familiar examples include work, heat flow, and advection, as discussed below . The word \"\"energy\"\" is also used outside of physics in many ways, which can lead to ambiguity and inconsistency. The vernacular terminology is not consistent with technical terminology. For example, the important public-service announcement, \"\"Please conserve energy\"\" uses vernacular notions of \"\"conservation\"\" and \"\"energy\"\" which make sense in their own context but are utterly incompatible with the technical notions of \"\"conservation\"\" and \"\"energy\"\" (such as are used in the law of conservation of energy). [12]In classical physics energy is considered a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time. In special relativity energy is also a scalar (although not a Lorentz scalar but a time component of the energy-momentum 4-vector ). [13] In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but not invariant with respect to rotations of space-time (= boosts ). Energy transfer Edit Because energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved (wherever it can be defined), it is important to remember that by definition of energy the transfer of energy between the \"\"system\"\" and adjacent regions is work. A familiar example is mechanical work. In simple cases this is written as: (1)if there are no other energy-transfer processes involved. Here is the amount of energy transferred, and represents the work done on the system. More generally, the energy transfer can be split into two categories: (2)where represents the heat flow into the system. There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy. In chemical systems, energy can be added to a system by means of adding substances with different chemical potentials, which potentials are then extracted (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Winding a clock would be adding energy to a mechanical system. These terms may be added to the above equation, or they can generally be subsumed into a quantity called \"\"energy addition term \"\" which refers to any type of energy carried over the surface of a control volume or system volume. Examples may be seen above, and many others can be imagined (for example, the kinetic energy of a stream of particles entering a system, or energy from a laser beam adds to system energy, without either being either work-done or heat-added, in the classic senses). (3)Where E in this general equation represents other additional advected energy terms not covered by work done on a system, or heat added to it. Energy is also transferred from potential energy () to kinetic energy () and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy can not be created or destroyed, so the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following: The equation can then be simplified further since (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and (half times mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding . Energy and the laws of motion Edit Template: Classical mechanics In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property since it is a conserved quantity . The Hamiltonian Edit The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. [14]The Lagrangian Edit Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph Louis Lagrange. This is even more fundamental than the Hamiltonian, and can be used to derive the equations of motion. It was invented in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (like systems with friction). Energy and thermodynamics Edit Internal energy Edit Internal energy – the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is related to the molecular structure and the degree of molecular activity and may be viewed as the sum of kinetic and potential energies of the molecules; it comprises the following types of energy: [15]Type Composition of Internal Energy (U)Sensible energythe portion of the internal energy of a system associated with kinetic energies (molecular translation, rotation, and vibration; electron translation and spin; and nuclear spin) of the molecules. Latent energy the internal energy associated with the phase of a system. Chemical energy the internal energy associated with the different kinds of aggregation of atoms in matter . Nuclear energy the tremendous amount of energy associated with the strong bonds within the nucleus of the atom itself. Energy interactionsthose types of energies not stored in the system (e.g. heat transfer, mass transfer, and work ), but which are recognized at the system boundary as they cross it, which represent gains or losses by a system during a process. Thermal energy the sum of sensible and latent forms of internal energy. The laws of thermodynamics Edit According to the second law of thermodynamics, work can be totally converted into heat, but not vice versa. This is a mathematical consequence of statistical mechanics. The first law of thermodynamics simply asserts that energy is conserved, [16] and that heat is included as a form of energy transfer. A commonly-used corollary of the first law is that for a \"\"system\"\" subject only to pressure forces and heat transfer (e.g. a cylinder-full of gas), the differential change in energy of the system (with a gain in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given by:,where the first term on the right is the heat transfer into the system, defined in terms of temperature T and entropy S (in which entropy increases and the change d S is positive when the system is heated); and the last term on the right hand side is identified as \"\"work\"\" done on the system, where pressure is P and volume V (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d V, is negative when work is done on the system). Although this equation is the standard text-book example of energy conservation in classical thermodynamics, it is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electric, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as advection of any form of energy other than heat, and because it contains a term that depends on temperature. The most general statement of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which temperature is undefinable. Energy is sometimes expressed as:,which is unsatisfactory [12] because there cannot exist any thermodynamic state functions W or Q that are meaningful on the right hand side of this equation, except perhaps in trivial cases. Equipartition of energy Edit The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator (a mass on a spring) is alternatively kinetic and potential. At two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic, and alternatively at two other points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called equipartition principle - total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom. This principle is vitally important to understanding the behavior of a quantity closely related to energy, called entropy. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (= is given new available energy states which are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between \"\"new\"\" and \"\"old\"\" degrees. This mathematical result is called the second law of thermodynamics . Oscillators, phonons, and photons Edit In an ensemble (connected collection) of unsynchronized oscillators, the average energy is spread equally between kinetic and potential types. In a solid, thermal energy (often referred to loosely as heat content) can be accurately described by an ensemble of thermal phonons that act as mechanical oscillators. In this model, thermal energy is equally kinetic and potential. In an ideal gas, the interaction potential between particles is essentially the delta function which stores no energy: thus, all of the thermal energy is kinetic. Because an electric oscillator ( LC circuit) is analogous to a mechanical oscillator, its energy must be, on average, equally kinetic and potential. It is entirely arbitrary whether the magnetic energy is considered kinetic and the electric energy considered potential, or vice versa. That is, either the inductor is analogous to the mass while the capacitor is analogous to the spring, or vice versa. By extension of the previous line of thought, in free space the electromagnetic field can be considered an ensemble of oscillators, meaning that radiation energy can be considered equally potential and kinetic. This model is useful, for example, when the electromagnetic Lagrangian is of primary interest and is interpreted in terms of potential and kinetic energy. On the other hand, in the key equation, the contribution is called the rest energy, and all other contributions to the energy are called kinetic energy. For a particle that has mass, this implies that the kinetic energy is at speeds much smaller than c, as can be proved by writing √ and expanding the square root to lowest order. By this line of reasoning, the energy of a photon is entirely kinetic, because the photon is massless and has no rest energy. This expression is useful, for example, when the energy-versus-momentum relationship is of primary interest. The two analyses are entirely consistent. The electric and magnetic degrees of freedom in item 1 are transverse to the direction of motion, while the speed in item 2 is along the direction of motion. For non-relativistic particles these two notions of potential versus kinetic energy are numerically equal, so the ambiguity is harmless, but not so for relativistic particles. Work and virtual work Edit Main article: Mechanics Work is force times distance. This says that the work () is equal to the line integral of the force F along a path C; for details see the mechanical work article. Work and thus energy is frame dependent. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball. Quantum mechanics Edit In quantum mechanics energy is defined in terms of the energy operator as a time derivative of the wave function. The Schrödinger equation equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. It thus can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of slow changing (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by the Planck equation (where is the Planck\\'s constant and the frequency). In the case of electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or photons . Relativity Edit When calculating kinetic energy (= work to accelerate a mass from zero speed to some finite speed) relativistically - using Lorentz transformations instead of Newtonian mechanics, Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it rest mass energy - energy which every mass must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of body:,wherem is the mass,c is the speed of light in vacuum,E is the rest mass energy. For example, consider electron - positron annihilation, in which the rest mass of individual particles is destroyed, but the inertia equivalent of the system of the two particles (its invariant mass) remains (since all energy is associated with mass), and this inertia and invariant mass is carried off by photons which individually are massless, but as a system retain their mass. This is a reversible process - the inverse process is called pair creation - in which the rest mass of particles is created from energy of two (or more) annihilating photons. In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation. [13]It is not uncommon to hear that energy is \"\"equivalent\"\" to mass. It would be more accurate to state that every energy has inertia and gravity equivalent, and because mass is a form of energy, then mass too has inertia and gravity associated with it. Measurement Edit File: X-ray microcalorimeter diagram.jpg There is no absolute measure of energy, because energy is defined as the work that one system does (or can do) on another. Thus, only of the transition of a system from one state into another can be defined and thus measured. Methods Edit The methods for the measurement of energy often deploy methods for the measurement of still more fundamental concepts of science, namely mass, distance, radiation, temperature, time, electric charge and electric current . Conventionally the technique most often employed is calorimetry, a thermodynamic technique that relies on the measurement of temperature using a thermometer or of intensity of radiation using a bolometer . Units Edit Main article: Units of energy Throughout the history of science, energy has been expressed in several different units such as ergs and calories. At present, the accepted unit of measurement for energy is the SI unit of energy, the joule . Forms of energy Edit File: Hot metalwork.jpg Classical mechanics distinguishes between potential energy, which is a function of the position of an object, and kinetic energy, which is a function of its movement. Both position and movement are relative to a frame of reference, which must be specified: this is often (and originally) an arbitrary fixed point on the surface of the Earth, the terrestrial frame of reference. It has been attempted to categorize all forms of energy as either kinetic or potential: this is not incorrect, but neither is it clear that it is a real simplification, as Feynman points out: These notions of potential and kinetic energy depend on a notion of length scale. For example, one can speak of macroscopic potential and kinetic energy, which do not include thermal potential and kinetic energy. Also what is called chemical potential energy (below) is a macroscopic notion, and closer examination shows that it is really the sum of the potential and kinetic energy on the atomic and subatomic scale. Similar remarks apply to nuclear \"\"potential\"\" energy and most other forms of energy. This dependence on length scale is non-problematic if the various length scales are decoupled, as is often the case ... but confusion can arise when different length scales are coupled, for instance when friction converts macroscopic work into microscopic thermal energy. Examples of the interconversion of energy Mechanical energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Lever Thermal energy Brakes Electric energy Dynamo Electromagnetic radiation Synchrotron Chemical energy Matches Nuclear energy Particle accelerator Potential energy Edit Main article: Potential energy Potential energy, symbols E p, V or Φ, is defined as the work done against a given force (= work of given force with minus sign) in changing the position of an object with respect to a reference position (often taken to be infinite separation). If F is the force and s is the displacement ,with the dot representing the scalar product of the two vectors . The name \"\"potential\"\" energy originally signified the idea that the energy could readily be transferred as work—at least in an idealized system (reversible process, see below). This is not completely true for any real system, but is often a reasonable first approximation in classical mechanics. The general equation above can be simplified in a number of common cases, notably when dealing with gravity or with elastic forces. Gravitational potential energy Edit Main article: Gravitational potential energy The gravitational force near the Earth\\'s surface varies very little with the height, h, and is equal to the mass, m, multiplied by the gravitational acceleration, g = 9.81 m/s². In these cases, the gravitational potential energy is given by A more general expression for the potential energy due to Newtonian gravitation between two bodies of masses m 1 and m 2, useful in astronomy, is,where r is the separation between the two bodies and G is the gravitational constant, 6.6742 (10)×10 −11 m 3 kg −1 s −2. [17] In this case, the reference point is the infinite separation of the two bodies. Elastic potential energy Edit File: Bouncing ball strobe edit.jpg Main article: Elastic potential energy Elastic potential energy is defined as a work needed to compress (or expand) a spring. The force, F, in a spring or any other system which obeys Hooke\\'s law is proportional to the extension or compression, x,where k is the force constant of the particular spring (or system). In this case, the calculated work becomes. Only when k is constant. Hooke\\'s law is a good approximation for behaviour of chemical bonds under normal conditions, i.e. when they are not being broken or formed. Kinetic energy Edit Main article: Kinetic energy Kinetic energy, symbols E k, T or K, is the work required to accelerate an object to a given speed. Indeed, calculating this work one easily obtains the following: At speeds approaching the speed of light, c, this work must be calculated using Lorentz transformations, which results in the following: This equation reduces to the one above it, at small (compared to c) speed. A mathematical by-product of this work (which is immediately seen in the last equation) is that even at rest a mass has the amount of energy equal to: This energy is thus called rest mass energy . Thermal energy Edit Examples of the interconversion of energy Thermal energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Steam turbine Thermal energy Heat exchanger Electric energy Thermocouple Electromagnetic radiation Hot objects Chemical energy Blast furnace Nuclear energy Supernova Main article: Thermal energy Thermal energy (of some media - gas, plasma, solid, etc) is the energy associated with the microscopical random motion of particles constituting the media. For example, in case of monoatomic gas it is just a kinetic energy of motion of atoms of gas as measured in the reference frame of the center of mass of gas. In case of many-atomic gas rotational and vibrational energy is involved. In the case of liquids and solids there is also potential energy (of interaction of atoms) involved, and so on. A heat is defined as a transfer (flow) of thermal energy across certain boundary (for example, from a hot body to cold via the area of their contact. A practical definition for small transfers of heat iswhere C v is the heat capacity of the system. This definition will fail if the system undergoes a phase transition —e.g. if ice is melting to water—as in these cases the system can absorb heat without increasing its temperature. In more complex systems, it is preferable to use the concept of internal energy rather than that of thermal energy (see Chemical energy below ). Despite the theoretical problems, the above definition is useful in the experimental measurement of energy changes. In a wide variety of situations, it is possible to use the energy released by a system to raise the temperature of another object, e.g. a bath of water. It is also possible to measure the amount of electric energy required to raise the temperature of the object by the same amount. The calorie was originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 °C (approximately 4.1855 J, although the definition later changed), and the British thermal unit was defined as the energy required to heat one pound of water by 1 °F (later fixed as 1055.06 J). Electric energy Edit Main article: Electromagnetism Examples of the interconversion of energy Electric energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Electric motor Thermal energy Resistor Electric energy Transformer Electromagnetic radiation Light-emitting diode Chemical energy Electrolysis Nuclear energy Synchrotron The electric potential energy of given configuration of charges is defined as the work which must be done against the Coulomb force to rearrange charges from infinite separation to this configuration (or the work done by the Coulomb force separating the charges from this configuration to infinity). For two point-like charges Q 1 and Q 2 at a distance r this work, and hence electric potential energy is equal to:where ε 0 is the electric constant of a vacuum, 10 7 /4π c 0 ² or 8.854188…×10 −12 F/m. [17] If the charge is accumulated in a capacitor (of capacitance C ), the reference configuration is usually selected not to be infinite separation of charges, but vice versa - charges at an extremely close proximity to each other (so there is zero net charge on each plate of a capacitor). The justification for this choice is purely practical - it is easier to measure both voltage difference and magnitude of charges on a capacitor plates not versus infinite separation of charges but rather versus discharged capacitor where charges return to close proximity to each other (electrons and ions recombine making the plates neutral). In this case the work and thus the electric potential energy becomes If an electric current passes through a resistor, electric energy is converted to heat; if the current passes through an electric appliance, some of the electric energy will be converted into other forms of energy (although some will always be lost as heat). The amount of electric energy due to an electric current can be expressed in a number of different ways:where U is the electric potential difference (in volts ), Q is the charge (in coulombs ), I is the current (in amperes ), t is the time for which the current flows (in seconds), P is the power (in watts) and R is the electric resistance (in ohms ). The last of these expressions is important in the practical measurement of energy, as potential difference, resistance and time can all be measured with considerable accuracy. Magnetic energy Edit There is no fundamental difference between magnetic energy and electric energy: the two phenomena are related by Maxwell\\'s equations. The potential energy of a magnet of magnetic moment m in a magnetic field B is defined as the work of magnetic force (actually of magnetic torque) on re-alignment of the vector of the magnetic dipole moment, and is equal:while the energy stored in a inductor (of inductance L) when current I is passing via it is. This second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage . Electromagnetic fields Edit Examples of the interconversion of energy Electromagnetic radiation is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Solar sail Thermal energy Solar collector Electric energy Solar cell Electromagnetic radiation Non-linear optics Chemical energy Photosynthesis Nuclear energy Mössbauer spectroscopy Calculating work needed to create an electric or magnetic field in unit volume (say, in a capacitor or an inductor) results in the electric and magnetic fields energy densities:and,in SI units. Electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, visible light or gamma rays, represents a flow of electromagnetic energy. Applying the above expressions to magnetic and electric components of electromagnetic field both the volumetric density and the flow of energy in e/m field can be calculated. The resulting Poynting vector, which is expressed asin SI units, gives the density of the flow of energy and its direction. The energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized (has discrete energy levels ). The spacing between these levels is equal towhere h is the Planck constant, 6.6260693 (11)×10 −34 Js, [17] and ν is the frequency of the radiation. This quantity of electromagnetic energy is usually called a photon. The photons which make up visible light have energies of 270–520 y J, equivalent to 160–310 k J/mol, the strength of weaker chemical bonds . Chemical energy Edit Main article: Chemical thermodynamics Examples of the interconversion of energy Chemical energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Muscle Thermal energy Fire Electric energy Fuel cell Electromagnetic radiation Glowworms Chemical energy Chemical reaction Chemical energy is the energy due to associations of atoms in molecules and various other kinds of aggregates of matter. It may be defined as a work done by electric forces during re-arrangement of mutual positions of electric charges, electrons and protons, in the process of aggregation. So, basically it is electrostatic potential energy of electric charges. If the chemical energy of a system decreases during a chemical reaction, the difference is transferred to the surroundings in some form (often heat or light ); on the other hand if the chemical energy of a system increases as a result of a chemical reaction - the difference then is supplied by the surroundings (usually again in form of heat or light ). For example,when two hydrogen atoms react to form a dihydrogen molecule, the chemical energy decreases by 724 z J (the bond energy of the H–H bond);when the electron is completely removed from a hydrogen atom, forming a hydrogen ion (in the gas phase), the chemical energy increases by 2.18 a J (the ionization energy of hydrogen). It is common to quote the changes in chemical energy for one mole of the substance in question: typical values for the change in molar chemical energy during a chemical reaction range from tens to hundreds of kilojoules per mole. The chemical energy as defined above is also referred to by chemists as the internal energy, U: technically, this is measured by keeping the volume of the system constant. However, most practical chemistry is performed at constant pressure and, if the volume changes during the reaction (e.g. a gas is given off), a correction must be applied to take account of the work done by or on the atmosphere to obtain the enthalpy, H :Δ H = Δ U + p Δ VA second correction, for the change in entropy, S, must also be performed to determine whether a chemical reaction will take place or not, giving the Gibbs free energy, G :Δ G = Δ H − T Δ SThese corrections are sometimes negligible, but often not (especially in reactions involving gases). Since the industrial revolution, the burning of coal, oil, natural gas or products derived from them has been a socially significant transformation of chemical energy into other forms of energy. the energy \"\"consumption\"\" (one should really speak of \"\"energy transformation\"\") of a society or country is often quoted in reference to the average energy released by the combustion of these fossil fuels :1 tonne of coal equivalent (TCE) = 29 GJ1 tonne of oil equivalent (TOE) = 41.87 GJOn the same basis, a tank-full of gasoline (45 litres, 12 gallons) is equivalent to about 1.6 GJ of chemical energy. Another chemically-based unit of measurement for energy is the \"\"tonne of TNT \"\", taken as 4.184 GJ. Hence, burning a tonne of oil releases about ten times as much energy as the explosion of one tonne of TNT: fortunately, the energy is usually released in a slower, more controlled manner. Simple examples of storage of chemical energy are batteries and food. When food is digested and metabolized (often with oxygen), chemical energy is released, which can in turn be transformed into heat, or by muscles into kinetic energy. Nuclear energy Edit Main article: Nuclear binding energy Examples of the interconversion of energy Nuclear binding energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Alpha radiation Thermal energy Sun Electrical energy Beta radiation Electromagnetic radiation Gamma radiation Chemical energy Radioactive decay Nuclear energy Nuclear isomerism Nuclear potential energy, along with electric potential energy, provides the energy released from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion processes. The result of both these processes are nuclei in which the more-optimal size of the nucleus allows the nuclear force (which is opposed by the electromagnetic force) to bind nuclear particles more tightly together than before the reaction. The Weak nuclear force (different from the strong force) provides the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay. The energy released in nuclear processes is so large that the relativistic change in mass (after the energy has been removed) can be as much as several parts per thousand. Nuclear particles ( nucleons) like protons and neutrons are not destroyed (law of conservation of baryon number) in fission and fusion processes. A few lighter particles may be created or destroyed (example: beta minus and beta plus decay, or electron capture decay), but these minor processes are not important to the immediate energy release in fission and fusion. Rather, fission and fusion release energy when collections of baryons become more tightly bound, and it is the energy associated with a fraction of the mass of the nucleons (but not the whole particles) which appears as the heat and electromagnetic radiation generated by nuclear reactions. This heat and radiation retains the \"\"missing\"\" mass, but the mass is missing only because it escapes in the form of heat and light, which retain the mass and conduct it out of the system where it is not measured. The energy from the Sun, also called solar energy, is an example of this form of energy conversion. In the Sun, the process of hydrogen fusion converts about 4 million metric tons of solar matter per second into light, which is radiated into space, but during this process, the number of total protons and neutrons in the sun does not change. In this system, the light itself retains the inertial equivalent of this mass, and indeed the mass itself (as a system), which represents 4 million tons per second of electromagnetic radiation, moving into space. Each of the helium nuclei which are formed in the process are less massive than the four protons from they were formed, but (to a good approximation), no particles or atoms are destroyed in the process of turning the sun\\'s nuclear potential energy into light. Surface energy Edit If there is any kind of tension in a surface, such as a stretched sheet of rubber or material interfaces, it is possible to define surface energy. In particular, any meeting of dissimilar materials that don\\'t mix will result in some kind of surface tension, if there is freedom for the surfaces to move then, as seen in capillary surfaces for example, the minimum energy will as usual be sought. A minimal surface, for example, represents the smallest possible energy that a surface can have if its energy is proportional to the area of the surface. For this reason, (open) soap films of small size are minimal surfaces (small size reduces gravity effects, and openness prevents pressure from building up. Note that a bubble is a minimum energy surface but not a minimal surface by definition). Transformations of energy Edit Main article: Energy conversion One form of energy can often be readily transformed into another with the help of a device- for instance, a battery, from chemical energy to electric energy; a dam: gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water (and the blades of a turbine) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric generator. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion, chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at maximum. At its lowest point the kinetic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no friction, the conversion of energy between these processes is perfect, and the pendulum will continue swinging forever. Energy can be converted into matter and vice versa. The formula E = mc ², derived by Albert Einstein (1905) quantifies the relationship between mass and rest energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by J. J. Thomson (1881), Henri Poincaré (1900), Friedrich Hasenöhrl (1904) and others (see Mass-energy equivalence#History for further information). Since is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of ordinary amount of mass (say, 1 kg) to other forms of energy can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~ Joules), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of energy transformation into matter (particles) are found in high energy nuclear physics . In nature, transformations of energy can be fundamentally classed into two kinds: those that are thermodynamically reversible, and those that are thermodynamically irreversible. A reversible process in thermodynamics is one in which no energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, however, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible exitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomization in a crystal). As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic heat death of the universe. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do produce work through a heat engine, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less. Law of conservation of energy Edit Main article: Conservation of energy Energy is subject to the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can neither be created (produced) nor destroyed by itself. It can only be transformed. Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception) [18] are also subject to strict local conservation laws, as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa. [7] [12] Conservation of energy is the mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time (that is, the indistinguishability of time intervals taken at different time) [19] - see Noether\\'s theorem . According to energy conservation law the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. This law is a fundamental principle of physics. It follows from the translational symmetry of time, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured. In quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is bywhich is similar in form to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since H and t are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics). In particle physics, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum, exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces (more accurately known as fundamental interactions ). Virtual photons (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which results in Coulomb law ), for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the Casimir force, for van der Waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena. Energy and life Edit Main article: Bioenergetics File: Energy and life.png Any living organism relies on an external source of energy—radiation from the Sun in the case of green plants; chemical energy in some form in the case of animals—to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000 Calories (6–8 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6) and stearin (C 57 H 110 O 6) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 OC 57 H 110 O 6 + 81.5O 2 → 57CO 2 + 55H 2 Oand some of the energy is used to convert ADP into ATPADP + HPO 4 2− → ATP + H 2 OThe rest of the chemical energy in the carbohydrate or fat is converted into heat: the ATP is used as a sort of \"\"energy currency\"\", and some of the chemical energy it contains when split and reacted with water, is used for other metabolism (at each stage of a metabolic pathway, some chemical energy is converted into heat). Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work: [20]gain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100 m race: 4 k Jgain in gravitational potential energy of a 150 kg weight lifted through 2 metres: 3k JDaily food intake of a normal adult: 6–8 MJIt would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical energy or radiation), and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies. However, in growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\"\"the surroundings\"\"). [21] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, [22] i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat. Energy and Information Society Edit Modern society continues to rely largely on fossil fuels to preserve economic growth and today\\'s standard of living. However, for the first time, physical limits of the Earth are met in our encounter with finite resources of oil and natural gas and its impact of greenhouse gas emissions onto the global climate. Never before has accurate accounting of our energy dependency been more pertinent to developing public policies for a sustainable development of our society, both in the industrial world and the emerging economies. At present, much emphasis is put on the introduction of a world-wide cap-and-trade system, to limit global emissions in greenhouse gases by balancing regional differences on a financial basis. In the near future, society may be permeated at all levels with information systems for direct feedback on energy usage, as fossil fuels continue to be used privately and for manufacturing and transportation services. Information in today\\'s society, focused on knowledge, news and entertainment, is expected to extend to energy usage in real-time. A collective medium for energy information may arise, serving to balance our individual and global energy dependence on fossil fuels. Yet, this development is not without restrictions, notably privacy issues. Recently, the Dutch Senate rejected a proposed law for mandatory national introduction of smart metering, in part, on the basis of privacy concerns [23] .

(July 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Energy Transformation in Energy Systems Language. Energy transformation, also termed as energy conversion, is the process of changing energy from one of its forms into another. In physics, energy is a quantity that provides the capacity to perform many actions—think of lifting or warming an object. In addition to being convertible, energy is transferable to a different location or object, but it cannot be created or destroyed. Energy in many of its forms may be used in natural processes, or to provide some service to society such as heating, refrigeration, lightening or performing mechanical work to operate machines. For example, in order to heat your home, your furnace can burn fuel, whose chemical potential energy is thus converted into thermal energy, which is then transferred to your home\\'s air in order to raise its temperature. In another example, an internal combustion engine burns gasoline of cause pressure that pushes the pistons, thus performing work in order to accelerate your vehicle, ultimately converting the fuel\\'s chemical energy to your vehicle\\'s additional kinetic energy corresponding to its increase in speed. Contents [ hide ]1 Entropy and limitations in conversion of thermal energy to other types2 Transformation of kinetic energy of charged particles to electric energy3 History of energy transformation from the early universe4 Examples4.1 Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines4.2 Other energy conversions5 See also6 References Entropy and limitations in conversion of thermal energy to other types [ edit]Conversions to thermal energy (thus raising the temperature) from other forms of energy, may occur with essentially 100% efficiency [ citation needed] (many types of friction do this). Conversion among non-thermal forms of energy may occur with fairly high efficiency, though there is always some energy dissipated thermally due to friction and similar processes. Sometimes the efficiency is close to 100%, such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum, or when an object orbits nearer or farther from another object, in space. Though, conversion of thermal energy to other forms, thus reducing the temperature of a system, has strict limitations, often keeping its efficiency much less than 100% (even when energy is not allowed to escape from the system). This is because thermal energy has already been partly spread out among many available states of a collection of microscopic particles constituting the system, which can have enormous numbers of possible combinations of momentum and position (these combinations are said to form a phase space ). In such circumstances, a measure called entropy, or evening-out of energy distributions, dictates that future states of an isolated system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution. In other words, there is no way to concentrate energy without spreading out energy somewhere else. Thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states. Such energy is sometimes considered \"\"degraded energy,\"\" because it is not entirely convertible a \"\"useful\"\" form, i.e. one that can do more than just affect temperature. The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that, for this reason, thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100%, only if the entropy (even-ness or disorder) of the universe is increased by other means, to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content. Otherwise, only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy (and thus, useful work), since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature, in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy...... Examples Transformation of kinetic energy of charged particles to electric energy [ edit]In order to make the energy transformation more efficient, it is desirable to avoid the thermal conversion. For example, the efficiency of nuclear energy reactors, where kinetic energy of nuclei is first converted to thermal energy and then to electric energy, lies around 35%. [1] [2] By direct conversion of kinetic energy to electric, i.e. by eliminating the thermal energy transformation, the efficiency of energy transformation process can be dramatically improved. [3]History of energy transformation from the early universe [ edit]Energy transformations in the universe over time are (generally) characterized by various kinds of energy which has been available since the Big Bang, later being \"\"released\"\" (that is, transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available to do it. Release of energy from gravitational potential: A direct transformation of energy occurs when hydrogen produced in the big bang collects into structures such as planets, in a process during which part of the gravitational potential is to be converted directly into heat. In Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune, for example, such heat from continued collapse of the planets\\' large gas atmospheres continues to drive most of the planets\\' weather systems, with atmospheric bands, winds, and powerful storms which are only partly powered by sunlight, however, on Uranus, little of this process occurs. On Earth a significant portion of heat output from interior of the planet, estimated at a third to half of the total, is caused by slow collapse of planetary materials to a smaller size, with output of gravitationally driven heat. Release of energy from radioactive potential: Familiar examples of other such processes transforming energy from the Big Bang include nuclear decay, in which energy is released which was originally \"\"stored\"\" in heavy isotopes, such as uranium and thorium. This energy was stored at the time of these elements\\' nucleosynthesis, a process which ultimately uses the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of type IIa supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. Such energy locked into uranium is triggered for sudden-release in nuclear fission bombs, and similar stored energies in atomic nuclei are released spontaneously, during most types of radioactive decay. In such processes, heat from decay of these atoms of radioisotope in the core of the Earth is transformed immediately to heat. This heat in turn may lift mountains, via plate tectonics and orogenesis. This slow lifting of terrain thus represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the heat energy. The stored potential energy may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a kind of mechanical potential energy which has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy which has been stored as potential energy in the Earth\\'s gravitational field, or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, the energy represented by these events had been stored in heavy atoms (or in the gravitational potential of the Earth). The energy stored in heat atoms had been stored as potential ever since the time that gravitational potentials transforming energy in the collapse of long-destroyed stars (supernovae) created these atoms, and in doing so, stored the energy within. Release of energy from hydrogen fusion potential: In other similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This resulted in hydrogen representing a store of potential energy which can be released by nuclear fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) snow-avalanches, or when water evaporates from oceans and is deposited high above sea level (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena on Earth. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by green plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. Release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action. Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of ways over time between releases, as more active energy. In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy, including heat. Examples [ edit]Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines [ edit]For instance, a coal -fired power plant involves these energy transformations: Chemical energy in the coal converted to thermal energy in the exhaust gases of combustion. Thermal energy of the exhaust gases converted into thermal energy of steam through the heat exchanger. Thermal energy of steam converted to mechanical energy in the turbine. Mechanical energy of the turbine converted to electrical energy by the generator, which is the ultimate output In such a system, the first and fourth step are highly efficient, but the second and third steps are less efficient. The most efficient gas-fired electrical power stations can achieve 50% conversion efficiency. Oil- and coal-fired stations achieve less. In a conventional automobile, these energy transformations are involved: Chemical energy in the fuel converted to kinetic energy of expanding gas via combustion Kinetic energy of expanding gas converted to linear piston movement Linear piston movement converted to rotary crankshaft movement Rotary crankshaft movement passed into transmission assembly Rotary movement passed out of transmission assembly Rotary movement passed through differential Rotary movement passed out of differential to drive wheels Rotary movement of drive wheels converted to linear motion of the vehicle. Other energy conversions [ edit]There are many different machines and transducers that convert one energy form into another. A short list of examples follows: Thermoelectric ( Heat → Electric energy)Geothermal power (Heat→ Electric energy)Heat engines, such as the internal combustion engine used in cars, or the steam engine (Heat → Mechanical energy)Ocean thermal power (Heat → Electric energy)Hydroelectric dams ( Gravitational potential energy → Electric energy)Electric generator ( Kinetic energy or Mechanical work → Electric energy)Fuel cells ( Chemical energy → Electric energy)Battery (electricity) (Chemical energy → Electric energy)Fire (Chemical energy → Heat and Light)Electric lamp (Electric energy → Heat and Light)Microphone (Sound → Electric energy)Wave power (Mechanical energy → Electric energy)Windmills ( Wind energy → Electric energy or Mechanical energy)Piezoelectrics (Strain → Electric energy)Friction (Kinetic energy → Heat)Electric heater (Electric energy → Heat)See also [ edit]Chaos theory Conservation law Conservation of energy Conservation of mass Groundwater energy balance Laws of thermodynamics Noether\\'s theorem Principles of energetics Uncertainty principle Energy quality Thermoeconomics Energy Accounting [ hide]v t e Energy Fundamental concepts Outline of energy Energy Units Conservation of energy Energetics Energy transformation Energy condition Energy transition Energy level Energy system Mass Negative mass Mass–energy equivalence Power Thermodynamics Quantum thermodynamics Laws of thermodynamics Thermodynamic system Thermodynamic state Thermodynamic potential Thermodynamic free energy Irreversible process Thermal reservoir Heat transfer Heat capacity Volume (thermodynamics)Thermodynamic equilibrium Thermal equilibrium Thermodynamic temperature Isolated system Entropy Free entropy Entropic force Negentropy Work Exergy Enthalpy Types Kinetic Magnetic Internal Thermal Potential Gravitational Elastic Electrical potential energy Mechanical Interatomic potential Electrical Magnetic Ionization Radiant Binding Nuclear binding energy Gravitational binding energy Chromodynamic Dark Quintessence Phantom Negative Chemical Rest Sound energy Surface energy Mechanical wave Sound wave Vacuum energy Zero-point energy Energy carriers Radiation Enthalpy Fuelfossil fuel Heat Latent heat Work Electricity Battery Capacitor Primary energy Fossil fuel Coal Petroleum Natural gas Gravitational energy Nuclear fuel Natural uranium Radiant energy Solar Wind Bioenergy Geothermal Hydropower Marine energy Energy system components Energy engineering Oil refinery Fossil-fuel power station Cogeneration Integrated gasification combined cycle Electric power Nuclear power Nuclear power plant Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Solar power Photovoltaic system Concentrated solar power Solar thermal energy Solar power tower Solar furnace Wind power Wind farm High-altitude wind power Geothermal power Hydropower Hydroelectricity Wave farm Tidal power Biomass Use and supply Energy consumption Energy storage World energy consumption Energy security Energy conservation Efficient energy use Transport Agriculture Renewable energy Sustainable energy Energy policy Energy development Worldwide energy supply South America USA Mexico Canada Europe Asia Africa Australia Misc.

(July 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message)Energy Transformation in Energy Systems Language. Energy transformation, also termed as energy conversion, is the process of changing energy from one of its forms into another. In physics, energy is a quantity that provides the capacity to perform many actions—think of lifting or warming an object. In addition to being convertible, energy is transferable to a different location or object, but it cannot be created or destroyed. Energy in many of its forms may be used in natural processes, or to provide some service to society such as heating, refrigeration, lightening or performing mechanical work to operate machines. For example, in order to heat your home, your furnace can burn fuel, whose chemical potential energy is thus converted into thermal energy, which is then transferred to your home\\'s air in order to raise its temperature. In another example, an internal combustion engine burns gasoline of cause pressure that pushes the pistons, thus performing work in order to accelerate your vehicle, ultimately converting the fuel\\'s chemical energy to your vehicle\\'s additional kinetic energy corresponding to its increase in speed. Contents [ hide ]1 Entropy and limitations in conversion of thermal energy to other types2 Transformation of kinetic energy of charged particles to electric energy3 History of energy transformation from the early universe4 Examples4.1 Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines4.2 Other energy conversions5 See also6 References Entropy and limitations in conversion of thermal energy to other types [ edit]Conversions to thermal energy (thus raising the temperature) from other forms of energy, may occur with essentially 100% efficiency [ citation needed] (many types of friction do this). Conversion among non-thermal forms of energy may occur with fairly high efficiency, though there is always some energy dissipated thermally due to friction and similar processes. Sometimes the efficiency is close to 100%, such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum, or when an object orbits nearer or farther from another object, in space. Though, conversion of thermal energy to other forms, thus reducing the temperature of a system, has strict limitations, often keeping its efficiency much less than 100% (even when energy is not allowed to escape from the system). This is because thermal energy has already been partly spread out among many available states of a collection of microscopic particles constituting the system, which can have enormous numbers of possible combinations of momentum and position (these combinations are said to form a phase space ). In such circumstances, a measure called entropy, or evening-out of energy distributions, dictates that future states of an isolated system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution. In other words, there is no way to concentrate energy without spreading out energy somewhere else. Thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states. Such energy is sometimes considered \"\"degraded energy,\"\" because it is not entirely convertible a \"\"useful\"\" form, i.e. one that can do more than just affect temperature. The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that, for this reason, thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100%, only if the entropy (even-ness or disorder) of the universe is increased by other means, to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content. Otherwise, only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy (and thus, useful work), since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature, in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy...... Examples Transformation of kinetic energy of charged particles to electric energy [ edit]In order to make the energy transformation more efficient, it is desirable to avoid the thermal conversion. For example, the efficiency of nuclear energy reactors, where kinetic energy of nuclei is first converted to thermal energy and then to electric energy, lies around 35%. [1] [2] By direct conversion of kinetic energy to electric, i.e. by eliminating the thermal energy transformation, the efficiency of energy transformation process can be dramatically improved. [3]History of energy transformation from the early universe [ edit]Energy transformations in the universe over time are (generally) characterized by various kinds of energy which has been available since the Big Bang, later being \"\"released\"\" (that is, transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available to do it. Release of energy from gravitational potential: A direct transformation of energy occurs when hydrogen produced in the big bang collects into structures such as planets, in a process during which part of the gravitational potential is to be converted directly into heat. In Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune, for example, such heat from continued collapse of the planets\\' large gas atmospheres continues to drive most of the planets\\' weather systems, with atmospheric bands, winds, and powerful storms which are only partly powered by sunlight, however, on Uranus, little of this process occurs. On Earth a significant portion of heat output from interior of the planet, estimated at a third to half of the total, is caused by slow collapse of planetary materials to a smaller size, with output of gravitationally driven heat. Release of energy from radioactive potential: Familiar examples of other such processes transforming energy from the Big Bang include nuclear decay, in which energy is released which was originally \"\"stored\"\" in heavy isotopes, such as uranium and thorium. This energy was stored at the time of these elements\\' nucleosynthesis, a process which ultimately uses the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of type IIa supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. Such energy locked into uranium is triggered for sudden-release in nuclear fission bombs, and similar stored energies in atomic nuclei are released spontaneously, during most types of radioactive decay. In such processes, heat from decay of these atoms of radioisotope in the core of the Earth is transformed immediately to heat. This heat in turn may lift mountains, via plate tectonics and orogenesis. This slow lifting of terrain thus represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the heat energy. The stored potential energy may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a kind of mechanical potential energy which has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy which has been stored as potential energy in the Earth\\'s gravitational field, or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, the energy represented by these events had been stored in heavy atoms (or in the gravitational potential of the Earth). The energy stored in heat atoms had been stored as potential ever since the time that gravitational potentials transforming energy in the collapse of long-destroyed stars (supernovae) created these atoms, and in doing so, stored the energy within. Release of energy from hydrogen fusion potential: In other similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This resulted in hydrogen representing a store of potential energy which can be released by nuclear fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) snow-avalanches, or when water evaporates from oceans and is deposited high above sea level (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena on Earth. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by green plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. Release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action. Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of ways over time between releases, as more active energy. In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy, including heat. Examples [ edit]Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines [ edit]For instance, a coal -fired power plant involves these energy transformations: Chemical energy in the coal converted to thermal energy in the exhaust gases of combustion. Thermal energy of the exhaust gases converted into thermal energy of steam through the heat exchanger. Thermal energy of steam converted to mechanical energy in the turbine. Mechanical energy of the turbine converted to electrical energy by the generator, which is the ultimate output In such a system, the first and fourth step are highly efficient, but the second and third steps are less efficient. The most efficient gas-fired electrical power stations can achieve 50% conversion efficiency. Oil- and coal-fired stations achieve less. In a conventional automobile, these energy transformations are involved: Chemical energy in the fuel converted to kinetic energy of expanding gas via combustion Kinetic energy of expanding gas converted to linear piston movement Linear piston movement converted to rotary crankshaft movement Rotary crankshaft movement passed into transmission assembly Rotary movement passed out of transmission assembly Rotary movement passed through differential Rotary movement passed out of differential to drive wheels Rotary movement of drive wheels converted to linear motion of the vehicle. Other energy conversions [ edit]There are many different machines and transducers that convert one energy form into another.

      "{'body': '\"This article is about the scalar physical quantity. For other uses, see Energy (disambiguation). Lightning is the electric breakdown of air by strong electric fields and is a flow of energy. The electric potential energy in the atmosphere changes into heat, light and sound which are other forms of energy. In physics, energy (from the Greek ἐνέργεια - energeia, \"\"activity, operation\"\", from ἐνεργός - energos, \"\"active, working\"\" [1]) is a scalar physical quantity that describes the amount of work that can be performed by a force, an attribute of objects and systems that is subject to a conservation law. Eight different forms of energy exist to explain all known natural phenomena. These forms include (but are not limited to) kinetic, potential, thermal, gravitational, sound, light, elastic, and electromagnetic energy. The forms of energy are often named after a related force. Any form of energy can be transformed into another form, but the total energy always remains the same. This principle, the conservation of energy, was first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. According to Noether\\'s theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. [2]Although the total energy of a system does not change with time, its value may depend on the frame of reference. For example, a seated passenger in a moving airplane has zero kinetic energy relative to the airplane, but non-zero kinetic energy relative to the Earth . Contents [ show]History Edit Main article: History of energy The word energy derives from Greek ἐνέργεια ( energeia ), which appears for the first time in the work Nicomachean Ethics [3] of Aristotle in the 4th century BC. In 1021 AD, the Arabian physicist, Alhazen, in the Book of Optics, held light rays to be streams of minute energy particles, stating that \"\"the smallest parts of light\"\" retain \"\"only properties that can be treated by geometry and verified by experiment \"\" and that \"\"they lack all sensible qualities except energy.\"\" [4] In 1121, Al-Khazini, in The Book of the Balance of Wisdom, proposed that the gravitational potential energy of a body varies depending on its distance from the centre of the Earth. [5]The concept of energy emerged out of the idea of vis viva, which Leibniz defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total vis viva was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz claimed that heat consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter — a view shared by Isaac Newton, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. In 1807, Thomas Young was the first to use the term \"\"energy\"\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense. [6] Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \"\" kinetic energy \"\" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term \"\" potential energy .\"\" It was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the caloric) or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum . William Thomson ( Lord Kelvin) amalgamated all of these laws into the laws of thermodynamics, which aided in the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes using the concept of energy by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan . During a 1961 lecture [7] for undergraduate students at the California Institute of Technology, Richard Feynman, a celebrated physics teacher and Nobel Laureate, said this about the concept of energy:“ There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law; it is exact, so far we know. The law is called conservation of energy; it states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity, which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number, and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. ”— The Feynman Lectures on Physics [7]Since 1918 it has been known that the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy, namely time. That is, energy is conserved because the laws of physics do not distinguish between different moments of time (see Noether\\'s theorem ). Energy in various contexts since the beginning of the universe Edit The concept of energy and its transformations is useful in explaining and predicting most natural phenomena. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often described by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations, since in practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces. The concept of energy is widespread in all sciences. In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living process. In an individual organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars) and lipids, which release energy when reacted with oxygen. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) The human equivalent energy indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500k J per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds\\' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts--many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum. [8] The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a “feel” for the use of a given amount of energy [9]In geology, continental drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth\\'s interior. [10] While meteorological phenomena like wind, rain, hail, snow, lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes, are all a result of energy transformations brought about by solar energy on the planet Earth. In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma ray bursts are the universe\\'s highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc. ), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy which has been available since the Big Bang, later being \"\"released\"\" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released which was originally \"\"stored\"\" in heavy isotopes (such as uranium and thorium ), by nucleosynthesis, a process which ultimately uses the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs. In a slower process, heat from nuclear decay of these atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat, which in turn may lift mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the heat energy, which may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store which has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy which has been stored as potential energy in the Earth\\'s gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks; but prior to this, represents energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed stars created these atoms. In another similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy which can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight from our Sun may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. Release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action. Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of ways over time between releases, as more active energy. In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy, including heat. Regarding applications of the concept of energy Edit Energy is subject to a strict global conservation law; that is, whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant. [11]The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified in various ways. For example, it is sometimes convenient to distinguish potential energy (which is a function of coordinates only) from kinetic energy (which is a function of coordinate time derivatives only). It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, electric energy, thermal energy, and other forms. These classifications overlap; for instance thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy. The transfer of energy can take various forms; familiar examples include work, heat flow, and advection, as discussed below . The word \"\"energy\"\" is also used outside of physics in many ways, which can lead to ambiguity and inconsistency. The vernacular terminology is not consistent with technical terminology. For example, the important public-service announcement, \"\"Please conserve energy\"\" uses vernacular notions of \"\"conservation\"\" and \"\"energy\"\" which make sense in their own context but are utterly incompatible with the technical notions of \"\"conservation\"\" and \"\"energy\"\" (such as are used in the law of conservation of energy). [12]In classical physics energy is considered a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time. In special relativity energy is also a scalar (although not a Lorentz scalar but a time component of the energy-momentum 4-vector ). [13] In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but not invariant with respect to rotations of space-time (= boosts ). Energy transfer Edit Because energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved (wherever it can be defined), it is important to remember that by definition of energy the transfer of energy between the \"\"system\"\" and adjacent regions is work. A familiar example is mechanical work. In simple cases this is written as: (1)if there are no other energy-transfer processes involved. Here is the amount of energy transferred, and represents the work done on the system. More generally, the energy transfer can be split into two categories: (2)where represents the heat flow into the system. There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy. In chemical systems, energy can be added to a system by means of adding substances with different chemical potentials, which potentials are then extracted (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Winding a clock would be adding energy to a mechanical system. These terms may be added to the above equation, or they can generally be subsumed into a quantity called \"\"energy addition term \"\" which refers to any type of energy carried over the surface of a control volume or system volume. Examples may be seen above, and many others can be imagined (for example, the kinetic energy of a stream of particles entering a system, or energy from a laser beam adds to system energy, without either being either work-done or heat-added, in the classic senses). (3)Where E in this general equation represents other additional advected energy terms not covered by work done on a system, or heat added to it. Energy is also transferred from potential energy () to kinetic energy () and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy can not be created or destroyed, so the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following: The equation can then be simplified further since (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and (half times mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding . Energy and the laws of motion Edit Template: Classical mechanics In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property since it is a conserved quantity . The Hamiltonian Edit The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. [14]The Lagrangian Edit Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph Louis Lagrange. This is even more fundamental than the Hamiltonian, and can be used to derive the equations of motion. It was invented in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (like systems with friction). Energy and thermodynamics Edit Internal energy Edit Internal energy – the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is related to the molecular structure and the degree of molecular activity and may be viewed as the sum of kinetic and potential energies of the molecules; it comprises the following types of energy: [15]Type Composition of Internal Energy (U)Sensible energythe portion of the internal energy of a system associated with kinetic energies (molecular translation, rotation, and vibration; electron translation and spin; and nuclear spin) of the molecules. Latent energy the internal energy associated with the phase of a system. Chemical energy the internal energy associated with the different kinds of aggregation of atoms in matter . Nuclear energy the tremendous amount of energy associated with the strong bonds within the nucleus of the atom itself. Energy interactionsthose types of energies not stored in the system (e.g. heat transfer, mass transfer, and work ), but which are recognized at the system boundary as they cross it, which represent gains or losses by a system during a process. Thermal energy the sum of sensible and latent forms of internal energy. The laws of thermodynamics Edit According to the second law of thermodynamics, work can be totally converted into heat, but not vice versa. This is a mathematical consequence of statistical mechanics. The first law of thermodynamics simply asserts that energy is conserved, [16] and that heat is included as a form of energy transfer. A commonly-used corollary of the first law is that for a \"\"system\"\" subject only to pressure forces and heat transfer (e.g. a cylinder-full of gas), the differential change in energy of the system (with a gain in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given by:,where the first term on the right is the heat transfer into the system, defined in terms of temperature T and entropy S (in which entropy increases and the change d S is positive when the system is heated); and the last term on the right hand side is identified as \"\"work\"\" done on the system, where pressure is P and volume V (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d V, is negative when work is done on the system). Although this equation is the standard text-book example of energy conservation in classical thermodynamics, it is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electric, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as advection of any form of energy other than heat, and because it contains a term that depends on temperature. The most general statement of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which temperature is undefinable. Energy is sometimes expressed as:,which is unsatisfactory [12] because there cannot exist any thermodynamic state functions W or Q that are meaningful on the right hand side of this equation, except perhaps in trivial cases. Equipartition of energy Edit The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator (a mass on a spring) is alternatively kinetic and potential. At two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic, and alternatively at two other points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called equipartition principle - total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom. This principle is vitally important to understanding the behavior of a quantity closely related to energy, called entropy. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (= is given new available energy states which are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between \"\"new\"\" and \"\"old\"\" degrees. This mathematical result is called the second law of thermodynamics . Oscillators, phonons, and photons Edit In an ensemble (connected collection) of unsynchronized oscillators, the average energy is spread equally between kinetic and potential types. In a solid, thermal energy (often referred to loosely as heat content) can be accurately described by an ensemble of thermal phonons that act as mechanical oscillators. In this model, thermal energy is equally kinetic and potential. In an ideal gas, the interaction potential between particles is essentially the delta function which stores no energy: thus, all of the thermal energy is kinetic. Because an electric oscillator ( LC circuit) is analogous to a mechanical oscillator, its energy must be, on average, equally kinetic and potential. It is entirely arbitrary whether the magnetic energy is considered kinetic and the electric energy considered potential, or vice versa. That is, either the inductor is analogous to the mass while the capacitor is analogous to the spring, or vice versa. By extension of the previous line of thought, in free space the electromagnetic field can be considered an ensemble of oscillators, meaning that radiation energy can be considered equally potential and kinetic. This model is useful, for example, when the electromagnetic Lagrangian is of primary interest and is interpreted in terms of potential and kinetic energy. On the other hand, in the key equation, the contribution is called the rest energy, and all other contributions to the energy are called kinetic energy. For a particle that has mass, this implies that the kinetic energy is at speeds much smaller than c, as can be proved by writing √ and expanding the square root to lowest order. By this line of reasoning, the energy of a photon is entirely kinetic, because the photon is massless and has no rest energy. This expression is useful, for example, when the energy-versus-momentum relationship is of primary interest. The two analyses are entirely consistent. The electric and magnetic degrees of freedom in item 1 are transverse to the direction of motion, while the speed in item 2 is along the direction of motion. For non-relativistic particles these two notions of potential versus kinetic energy are numerically equal, so the ambiguity is harmless, but not so for relativistic particles. Work and virtual work Edit Main article: Mechanics Work is force times distance. This says that the work () is equal to the line integral of the force F along a path C; for details see the mechanical work article. Work and thus energy is frame dependent. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball. Quantum mechanics Edit In quantum mechanics energy is defined in terms of the energy operator as a time derivative of the wave function. The Schrödinger equation equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. It thus can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of slow changing (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by the Planck equation (where is the Planck\\'s constant and the frequency). In the case of electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or photons . Relativity Edit When calculating kinetic energy (= work to accelerate a mass from zero speed to some finite speed) relativistically - using Lorentz transformations instead of Newtonian mechanics, Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it rest mass energy - energy which every mass must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of body:,wherem is the mass,c is the speed of light in vacuum,E is the rest mass energy. For example, consider electron - positron annihilation, in which the rest mass of individual particles is destroyed, but the inertia equivalent of the system of the two particles (its invariant mass) remains (since all energy is associated with mass), and this inertia and invariant mass is carried off by photons which individually are massless, but as a system retain their mass. This is a reversible process - the inverse process is called pair creation - in which the rest mass of particles is created from energy of two (or more) annihilating photons. In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation. [13]It is not uncommon to hear that energy is \"\"equivalent\"\" to mass. It would be more accurate to state that every energy has inertia and gravity equivalent, and because mass is a form of energy, then mass too has inertia and gravity associated with it. Measurement Edit File: X-ray microcalorimeter diagram.jpg There is no absolute measure of energy, because energy is defined as the work that one system does (or can do) on another. Thus, only of the transition of a system from one state into another can be defined and thus measured. Methods Edit The methods for the measurement of energy often deploy methods for the measurement of still more fundamental concepts of science, namely mass, distance, radiation, temperature, time, electric charge and electric current . Conventionally the technique most often employed is calorimetry, a thermodynamic technique that relies on the measurement of temperature using a thermometer or of intensity of radiation using a bolometer . Units Edit Main article: Units of energy Throughout the history of science, energy has been expressed in several different units such as ergs and calories. At present, the accepted unit of measurement for energy is the SI unit of energy, the joule . Forms of energy Edit File: Hot metalwork.jpg Classical mechanics distinguishes between potential energy, which is a function of the position of an object, and kinetic energy, which is a function of its movement. Both position and movement are relative to a frame of reference, which must be specified: this is often (and originally) an arbitrary fixed point on the surface of the Earth, the terrestrial frame of reference. It has been attempted to categorize all forms of energy as either kinetic or potential: this is not incorrect, but neither is it clear that it is a real simplification, as Feynman points out: These notions of potential and kinetic energy depend on a notion of length scale. For example, one can speak of macroscopic potential and kinetic energy, which do not include thermal potential and kinetic energy. Also what is called chemical potential energy (below) is a macroscopic notion, and closer examination shows that it is really the sum of the potential and kinetic energy on the atomic and subatomic scale. Similar remarks apply to nuclear \"\"potential\"\" energy and most other forms of energy. This dependence on length scale is non-problematic if the various length scales are decoupled, as is often the case ... but confusion can arise when different length scales are coupled, for instance when friction converts macroscopic work into microscopic thermal energy. Examples of the interconversion of energy Mechanical energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Lever Thermal energy Brakes Electric energy Dynamo Electromagnetic radiation Synchrotron Chemical energy Matches Nuclear energy Particle accelerator Potential energy Edit Main article: Potential energy Potential energy, symbols E p, V or Φ, is defined as the work done against a given force (= work of given force with minus sign) in changing the position of an object with respect to a reference position (often taken to be infinite separation). If F is the force and s is the displacement ,with the dot representing the scalar product of the two vectors . The name \"\"potential\"\" energy originally signified the idea that the energy could readily be transferred as work—at least in an idealized system (reversible process, see below). This is not completely true for any real system, but is often a reasonable first approximation in classical mechanics. The general equation above can be simplified in a number of common cases, notably when dealing with gravity or with elastic forces. Gravitational potential energy Edit Main article: Gravitational potential energy The gravitational force near the Earth\\'s surface varies very little with the height, h, and is equal to the mass, m, multiplied by the gravitational acceleration, g = 9.81 m/s². In these cases, the gravitational potential energy is given by A more general expression for the potential energy due to Newtonian gravitation between two bodies of masses m 1 and m 2, useful in astronomy, is,where r is the separation between the two bodies and G is the gravitational constant, 6.6742 (10)×10 −11 m 3 kg −1 s −2. [17] In this case, the reference point is the infinite separation of the two bodies. Elastic potential energy Edit File: Bouncing ball strobe edit.jpg Main article: Elastic potential energy Elastic potential energy is defined as a work needed to compress (or expand) a spring. The force, F, in a spring or any other system which obeys Hooke\\'s law is proportional to the extension or compression, x,where k is the force constant of the particular spring (or system). In this case, the calculated work becomes. Only when k is constant. Hooke\\'s law is a good approximation for behaviour of chemical bonds under normal conditions, i.e. when they are not being broken or formed. Kinetic energy Edit Main article: Kinetic energy Kinetic energy, symbols E k, T or K, is the work required to accelerate an object to a given speed. Indeed, calculating this work one easily obtains the following: At speeds approaching the speed of light, c, this work must be calculated using Lorentz transformations, which results in the following: This equation reduces to the one above it, at small (compared to c) speed. A mathematical by-product of this work (which is immediately seen in the last equation) is that even at rest a mass has the amount of energy equal to: This energy is thus called rest mass energy . Thermal energy Edit Examples of the interconversion of energy Thermal energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Steam turbine Thermal energy Heat exchanger Electric energy Thermocouple Electromagnetic radiation Hot objects Chemical energy Blast furnace Nuclear energy Supernova Main article: Thermal energy Thermal energy (of some media - gas, plasma, solid, etc) is the energy associated with the microscopical random motion of particles constituting the media. For example, in case of monoatomic gas it is just a kinetic energy of motion of atoms of gas as measured in the reference frame of the center of mass of gas. In case of many-atomic gas rotational and vibrational energy is involved. In the case of liquids and solids there is also potential energy (of interaction of atoms) involved, and so on. A heat is defined as a transfer (flow) of thermal energy across certain boundary (for example, from a hot body to cold via the area of their contact. A practical definition for small transfers of heat iswhere C v is the heat capacity of the system. This definition will fail if the system undergoes a phase transition —e.g. if ice is melting to water—as in these cases the system can absorb heat without increasing its temperature. In more complex systems, it is preferable to use the concept of internal energy rather than that of thermal energy (see Chemical energy below ). Despite the theoretical problems, the above definition is useful in the experimental measurement of energy changes. In a wide variety of situations, it is possible to use the energy released by a system to raise the temperature of another object, e.g. a bath of water. It is also possible to measure the amount of electric energy required to raise the temperature of the object by the same amount. The calorie was originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 °C (approximately 4.1855 J, although the definition later changed), and the British thermal unit was defined as the energy required to heat one pound of water by 1 °F (later fixed as 1055.06 J). Electric energy Edit Main article: Electromagnetism Examples of the interconversion of energy Electric energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Electric motor Thermal energy Resistor Electric energy Transformer Electromagnetic radiation Light-emitting diode Chemical energy Electrolysis Nuclear energy Synchrotron The electric potential energy of given configuration of charges is defined as the work which must be done against the Coulomb force to rearrange charges from infinite separation to this configuration (or the work done by the Coulomb force separating the charges from this configuration to infinity). For two point-like charges Q 1 and Q 2 at a distance r this work, and hence electric potential energy is equal to:where ε 0 is the electric constant of a vacuum, 10 7 /4π c 0 ² or 8.854188…×10 −12 F/m. [17] If the charge is accumulated in a capacitor (of capacitance C ), the reference configuration is usually selected not to be infinite separation of charges, but vice versa - charges at an extremely close proximity to each other (so there is zero net charge on each plate of a capacitor). The justification for this choice is purely practical - it is easier to measure both voltage difference and magnitude of charges on a capacitor plates not versus infinite separation of charges but rather versus discharged capacitor where charges return to close proximity to each other (electrons and ions recombine making the plates neutral). In this case the work and thus the electric potential energy becomes If an electric current passes through a resistor, electric energy is converted to heat; if the current passes through an electric appliance, some of the electric energy will be converted into other forms of energy (although some will always be lost as heat). The amount of electric energy due to an electric current can be expressed in a number of different ways:where U is the electric potential difference (in volts ), Q is the charge (in coulombs ), I is the current (in amperes ), t is the time for which the current flows (in seconds), P is the power (in watts) and R is the electric resistance (in ohms ). The last of these expressions is important in the practical measurement of energy, as potential difference, resistance and time can all be measured with considerable accuracy. Magnetic energy Edit There is no fundamental difference between magnetic energy and electric energy: the two phenomena are related by Maxwell\\'s equations. The potential energy of a magnet of magnetic moment m in a magnetic field B is defined as the work of magnetic force (actually of magnetic torque) on re-alignment of the vector of the magnetic dipole moment, and is equal:while the energy stored in a inductor (of inductance L) when current I is passing via it is. This second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage . Electromagnetic fields Edit Examples of the interconversion of energy Electromagnetic radiation is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Solar sail Thermal energy Solar collector Electric energy Solar cell Electromagnetic radiation Non-linear optics Chemical energy Photosynthesis Nuclear energy Mössbauer spectroscopy Calculating work needed to create an electric or magnetic field in unit volume (say, in a capacitor or an inductor) results in the electric and magnetic fields energy densities:and,in SI units. Electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, visible light or gamma rays, represents a flow of electromagnetic energy. Applying the above expressions to magnetic and electric components of electromagnetic field both the volumetric density and the flow of energy in e/m field can be calculated. The resulting Poynting vector, which is expressed asin SI units, gives the density of the flow of energy and its direction. The energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized (has discrete energy levels ). The spacing between these levels is equal towhere h is the Planck constant, 6.6260693 (11)×10 −34 Js, [17] and ν is the frequency of the radiation. This quantity of electromagnetic energy is usually called a photon. The photons which make up visible light have energies of 270–520 y J, equivalent to 160–310 k J/mol, the strength of weaker chemical bonds . Chemical energy Edit Main article: Chemical thermodynamics Examples of the interconversion of energy Chemical energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Muscle Thermal energy Fire Electric energy Fuel cell Electromagnetic radiation Glowworms Chemical energy Chemical reaction Chemical energy is the energy due to associations of atoms in molecules and various other kinds of aggregates of matter. It may be defined as a work done by electric forces during re-arrangement of mutual positions of electric charges, electrons and protons, in the process of aggregation. So, basically it is electrostatic potential energy of electric charges. If the chemical energy of a system decreases during a chemical reaction, the difference is transferred to the surroundings in some form (often heat or light ); on the other hand if the chemical energy of a system increases as a result of a chemical reaction - the difference then is supplied by the surroundings (usually again in form of heat or light ). For example,when two hydrogen atoms react to form a dihydrogen molecule, the chemical energy decreases by 724 z J (the bond energy of the H–H bond);when the electron is completely removed from a hydrogen atom, forming a hydrogen ion (in the gas phase), the chemical energy increases by 2.18 a J (the ionization energy of hydrogen). It is common to quote the changes in chemical energy for one mole of the substance in question: typical values for the change in molar chemical energy during a chemical reaction range from tens to hundreds of kilojoules per mole. The chemical energy as defined above is also referred to by chemists as the internal energy, U: technically, this is measured by keeping the volume of the system constant. However, most practical chemistry is performed at constant pressure and, if the volume changes during the reaction (e.g. a gas is given off), a correction must be applied to take account of the work done by or on the atmosphere to obtain the enthalpy, H :Δ H = Δ U + p Δ VA second correction, for the change in entropy, S, must also be performed to determine whether a chemical reaction will take place or not, giving the Gibbs free energy, G :Δ G = Δ H − T Δ SThese corrections are sometimes negligible, but often not (especially in reactions involving gases). Since the industrial revolution, the burning of coal, oil, natural gas or products derived from them has been a socially significant transformation of chemical energy into other forms of energy. the energy \"\"consumption\"\" (one should really speak of \"\"energy transformation\"\") of a society or country is often quoted in reference to the average energy released by the combustion of these fossil fuels :1 tonne of coal equivalent (TCE) = 29 GJ1 tonne of oil equivalent (TOE) = 41.87 GJOn the same basis, a tank-full of gasoline (45 litres, 12 gallons) is equivalent to about 1.6 GJ of chemical energy. Another chemically-based unit of measurement for energy is the \"\"tonne of TNT \"\", taken as 4.184 GJ. Hence, burning a tonne of oil releases about ten times as much energy as the explosion of one tonne of TNT: fortunately, the energy is usually released in a slower, more controlled manner. Simple examples of storage of chemical energy are batteries and food. When food is digested and metabolized (often with oxygen), chemical energy is released, which can in turn be transformed into heat, or by muscles into kinetic energy. Nuclear energy Edit Main article: Nuclear binding energy Examples of the interconversion of energy Nuclear binding energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Alpha radiation Thermal energy Sun Electrical energy Beta radiation Electromagnetic radiation Gamma radiation Chemical energy Radioactive decay Nuclear energy Nuclear isomerism Nuclear potential energy, along with electric potential energy, provides the energy released from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion processes. The result of both these processes are nuclei in which the more-optimal size of the nucleus allows the nuclear force (which is opposed by the electromagnetic force) to bind nuclear particles more tightly together than before the reaction. The Weak nuclear force (different from the strong force) provides the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay. The energy released in nuclear processes is so large that the relativistic change in mass (after the energy has been removed) can be as much as several parts per thousand. Nuclear particles ( nucleons) like protons and neutrons are not destroyed (law of conservation of baryon number) in fission and fusion processes. A few lighter particles may be created or destroyed (example: beta minus and beta plus decay, or electron capture decay), but these minor processes are not important to the immediate energy release in fission and fusion. Rather, fission and fusion release energy when collections of baryons become more tightly bound, and it is the energy associated with a fraction of the mass of the nucleons (but not the whole particles) which appears as the heat and electromagnetic radiation generated by nuclear reactions. This heat and radiation retains the \"\"missing\"\" mass, but the mass is missing only because it escapes in the form of heat and light, which retain the mass and conduct it out of the system where it is not measured. The energy from the Sun, also called solar energy, is an example of this form of energy conversion. In the Sun, the process of hydrogen fusion converts about 4 million metric tons of solar matter per second into light, which is radiated into space, but during this process, the number of total protons and neutrons in the sun does not change. In this system, the light itself retains the inertial equivalent of this mass, and indeed the mass itself (as a system), which represents 4 million tons per second of electromagnetic radiation, moving into space. Each of the helium nuclei which are formed in the process are less massive than the four protons from they were formed, but (to a good approximation), no particles or atoms are destroyed in the process of turning the sun\\'s nuclear potential energy into light. Surface energy Edit If there is any kind of tension in a surface, such as a stretched sheet of rubber or material interfaces, it is possible to define surface energy. In particular, any meeting of dissimilar materials that don\\'t mix will result in some kind of surface tension, if there is freedom for the surfaces to move then, as seen in capillary surfaces for example, the minimum energy will as usual be sought. A minimal surface, for example, represents the smallest possible energy that a surface can have if its energy is proportional to the area of the surface. For this reason, (open) soap films of small size are minimal surfaces (small size reduces gravity effects, and openness prevents pressure from building up. Note that a bubble is a minimum energy surface but not a minimal surface by definition). Transformations of energy Edit Main article: Energy conversion One form of energy can often be readily transformed into another with the help of a device- for instance, a battery, from chemical energy to electric energy; a dam: gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water (and the blades of a turbine) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric generator. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion, chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at maximum. At its lowest point the kinetic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no friction, the conversion of energy between these processes is perfect, and the pendulum will continue swinging forever. Energy can be converted into matter and vice versa. The formula E = mc ², derived by Albert Einstein (1905) quantifies the relationship between mass and rest energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by J. J. Thomson (1881), Henri Poincaré (1900), Friedrich Hasenöhrl (1904) and others (see Mass-energy equivalence#History for further information). Since is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of ordinary amount of mass (say, 1 kg) to other forms of energy can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~ Joules), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of energy transformation into matter (particles) are found in high energy nuclear physics . In nature, transformations of energy can be fundamentally classed into two kinds: those that are thermodynamically reversible, and those that are thermodynamically irreversible. A reversible process in thermodynamics is one in which no energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, however, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible exitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomization in a crystal). As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic heat death of the universe. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do produce work through a heat engine, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less. Law of conservation of energy Edit Main article: Conservation of energy Energy is subject to the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can neither be created (produced) nor destroyed by itself. It can only be transformed. Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception) [18] are also subject to strict local conservation laws, as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa. [7] [12] Conservation of energy is the mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time (that is, the indistinguishability of time intervals taken at different time) [19] - see Noether\\'s theorem . According to energy conservation law the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. This law is a fundamental principle of physics. It follows from the translational symmetry of time, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured. In quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is bywhich is similar in form to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since H and t are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics). In particle physics, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum, exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces (more accurately known as fundamental interactions ). Virtual photons (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which results in Coulomb law ), for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the Casimir force, for van der Waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena. Energy and life Edit Main article: Bioenergetics File: Energy and life.png Any living organism relies on an external source of energy—radiation from the Sun in the case of green plants; chemical energy in some form in the case of animals—to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000 Calories (6–8 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6) and stearin (C 57 H 110 O 6) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 OC 57 H 110 O 6 + 81.5O 2 → 57CO 2 + 55H 2 Oand some of the energy is used to convert ADP into ATPADP + HPO 4 2− → ATP + H 2 OThe rest of the chemical energy in the carbohydrate or fat is converted into heat: the ATP is used as a sort of \"\"energy currency\"\", and some of the chemical energy it contains when split and reacted with water, is used for other metabolism (at each stage of a metabolic pathway, some chemical energy is converted into heat). Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work: [20]gain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100 m race: 4 k Jgain in gravitational potential energy of a 150 kg weight lifted through 2 metres: 3k JDaily food intake of a normal adult: 6–8 MJIt would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical energy or radiation), and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies. However, in growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\"\"the surroundings\"\"). [21] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, [22] i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat. Energy and Information Society Edit Modern society continues to rely largely on fossil fuels to preserve economic growth and today\\'s standard of living. However, for the first time, physical limits of the Earth are met in our encounter with finite resources of oil and natural gas and its impact of greenhouse gas emissions onto the global climate. Never before has accurate accounting of our energy dependency been more pertinent to developing public policies for a sustainable development of our society, both in the industrial world and the emerging economies. At present, much emphasis is put on the introduction of a world-wide cap-and-trade system, to limit global emissions in greenhouse gases by balancing regional differences on a financial basis. In the near future, society may be permeated at all levels with information systems for direct feedback on energy usage, as fossil fuels continue to be used privately and for manufacturing and transportation services. Information in today\\'s society, focused on knowledge, news and entertainment, is expected to extend to energy usage in real-time. A collective medium for energy information may arise, serving to balance our individual and global energy dependence on fossil fuels. Yet, this development is not without restrictions, notably privacy issues. Recently, the Dutch Senate rejected a proposed law for mandatory national introduction of smart metering, in part, on the basis of privacy concerns [23] .

It is energy contained in raw fuels, and other forms of energy received as input to a system. Primary energy can be non-renewable or renewable. Total primary energy supply ( TPES) is a term used to indicate the sum of production and imports subtracting exports and storage changes. [2]The concept of primary energy is used in energy statistics in the compilation of energy balances, as well as in the field of energetics. In energetics, a primary energy source (PES) refers to the energy forms required by the energy sector to generate the supply of energy carriers used by human society. [3]Secondary energy is a carrier of energy, such as electricity. These are produced by conversion from a primary energy source. The use of primary energy as a measure ignores conversion efficiency. Thus forms of energy with poor conversion efficiency, particularly the thermal sources, coal, gas and nuclear are overstated, whereas energy sources such as hydroelectricity which are converted efficiently, while a small fraction of primary energy are significantly more important than their total raw energy supply may seem to imply. [ citation needed]PE and TPES are better defined in the context of worldwide energy supply.

Primary energy sourcesconverted by Energy system componentto Energy carriers (main)Non-renewable sources [nb 1]Fossil fuels Oil (or crude oil)Oil refinery Fuel oil Coal or natural gas Fossil fuel power station Enthalpy, mechanical work or electricity Mineral fuels Natural uranium [nb 2]Nuclear power plant ( thermonuclear fission) Electricity Natural thorium Thorium breeder reactor Enthalpy or electricity Renewable sources Solar energy Photovoltaic power plant ( see also Solar power) Electricity Solar power tower, solar furnace ( see also Solar thermal energy) Enthalpy Wind energy Wind farm ( see also Wind power) Mechanical work or electricity Falling and flowing water, tidal energy [4]Hydropower station, wave farm, tidal power station Mechanical work or electricity Biomass sources Biomass power plant Enthalpy or electricity Geothermal energy Geothermal power station Enthalpy or electricity Usable energy [ edit]Main article: exergy Primary energy sources are transformed by the energy sector to generate energy carriers. Primary energy sources are transformed in energy conversion processes to more convenient forms of energy that can directly be used by society, such as electrical energy, refined fuels, or synthetic fuels such as hydrogen fuel. In the field of energetics, these forms are called energy carriers and correspond to the concept of \"\"secondary energy\"\" in energy statistics. Conversion to energy carriers (or secondary energy) [ edit]Energy carriers are energy forms which have been transformed from primary energy sources. Electricity is one of the most common energy carriers, being transformed from various primary energy sources such as coal, oil, natural gas, and wind. Electricity is particularly useful since it has low entropy (is highly ordered) and so can be converted into other forms of energy very efficiently. District heating is another example of secondary energy. [5]According to the laws of thermodynamics, primary energy sources cannot be produced. They must be available to society to enable the production of energy carriers. [3]Conversion efficiency varies. For thermal energy, electricity and mechanical energy production is limited by Carnot\\'s theorem, and generates a lot of waste heat. Other non-thermal conversions can be more efficient. For example, while wind turbines do not capture all of the wind\\'s energy, they have a high conversion efficiency and generate very little waste heat since wind energy is low entropy. In principle solar photovoltaic conversions could be very efficient, but current conversion can only be done well for narrow ranges of wavelength, whereas solar thermal is also subject to Carnot efficiency limits. Hydroelectric power is also very ordered, and converted very efficiently. The amount of usable energy is the exergy of a system. Site and source energy [ edit]Site energy is the term used in North America for the amount of end-use energy of all forms consumed at a specified location. This can be a mix of primary energy (such as natural gas burned at the site) and secondary energy (such as electricity). Site energy is measured at the campus, building, or sub-building level and is the basis for energy charges on utility bills. [6]Source energy, in contrast, is the term used in North America for the amount of primary energy consumed in order to provide a facility’s site energy. It is always greater than the site energy, as it includes all site energy and adds to it the energy lost during transmission, delivery, and conversion. [7] While source or primary energy provides a more complete picture of energy consumption, it cannot be measured directly and must be calculated using conversion factors from site energy measurements. [6] For electricity, a typical value is three units of source energy for one unit of site energy. [8] However, this can vary considerably depending on factors such as the primary energy source or fuel type, the type of power plant, and the transmission infrastructure. One full set of conversion factors is available as technical reference from Energy STAR. [9]Either site or source energy can be an appropriate metric when comparing or analyzing energy use of different facilities. The U. S Energy Information Administration, for example, uses primary (source) energy for its energy overviews [10] but site energy for its Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey [11] and Residential Building Energy Consumption Survey. [12] The US Environmental Protection Agency \\'s Energy STAR program recommends using source energy, [13] and the US Department of Energy uses site energy in its definition of a zero net energy building. [14]Outlook [ edit]Primary energy outlook. Projected from 2007 ( EIA, 2010)Energy accidents and fatalities [ edit]Main article: Energy accidents Energy accidents are accidents that occur in systems that provide energy or power. These can result in fatalities, as can the normal running of many systems, for example those deaths due to pollution. Globally, coal is responsible for 100,000 deaths per trillion k Wh. [15]See also [ edit]Energy portal Energy and society Energy development Energy mix Energy system Future energy development Notes [ edit]^ At the scale of earth sciences, all primary energy sources can be considered to be renewable. The non-renewable essence of resources (PES) is due to the scale of needs within human society. In certain situations, the use of resources by human society is performed at a much higher rate than the minimum rate at which it can be geophysically renewed. This is the rationale behind the differentiation between non-renewable primary energy sources (oil, coal, gas, uranium) and renewable primary energy sources (wind, solar, hydro).^ Some nuclear fuels, such as plutonium or depleted uranium, are also used in nuclear fission power plants. However, they cannot be considered to be primary energy sources as they cannot be found in nature in any quantity. Indeed, there must be a consumption of natural uranium (primary energy source) in order to make these other nuclear fuels available.

In addition to being convertible, energy is transferable to a different location or object, but it cannot be created or destroyed. Energy in many of its forms may be used in natural processes, or to provide some service to society such as heating, refrigeration, lightening or performing mechanical work to operate machines. For example, in order to heat your home, your furnace can burn fuel, whose chemical potential energy is thus converted into thermal energy, which is then transferred to your home\\'s air in order to raise its temperature. In another example, an internal combustion engine burns gasoline of cause pressure that pushes the pistons, thus performing work in order to accelerate your vehicle, ultimately converting the fuel\\'s chemical energy to your vehicle\\'s additional kinetic energy corresponding to its increase in speed. Contents [ hide ]1 Entropy and limitations in conversion of thermal energy to other types2 Transformation of kinetic energy of charged particles to electric energy3 History of energy transformation from the early universe4 Examples4.1 Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines4.2 Other energy conversions5 See also6 References Entropy and limitations in conversion of thermal energy to other types [ edit]Conversions to thermal energy (thus raising the temperature) from other forms of energy, may occur with essentially 100% efficiency [ citation needed] (many types of friction do this). Conversion among non-thermal forms of energy may occur with fairly high efficiency, though there is always some energy dissipated thermally due to friction and similar processes. Sometimes the efficiency is close to 100%, such as when potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as an object falls in vacuum, or when an object orbits nearer or farther from another object, in space. Though, conversion of thermal energy to other forms, thus reducing the temperature of a system, has strict limitations, often keeping its efficiency much less than 100% (even when energy is not allowed to escape from the system). This is because thermal energy has already been partly spread out among many available states of a collection of microscopic particles constituting the system, which can have enormous numbers of possible combinations of momentum and position (these combinations are said to form a phase space ). In such circumstances, a measure called entropy, or evening-out of energy distributions, dictates that future states of an isolated system must be of at least equal evenness in energy distribution. In other words, there is no way to concentrate energy without spreading out energy somewhere else. Thermal energy in equilibrium at a given temperature already represents the maximal evening-out of energy between all possible states. Such energy is sometimes considered \"\"degraded energy,\"\" because it is not entirely convertible a \"\"useful\"\" form, i.e. one that can do more than just affect temperature. The second law of thermodynamics is a way of stating that, for this reason, thermal energy in a system may be converted to other kinds of energy with efficiencies approaching 100%, only if the entropy (even-ness or disorder) of the universe is increased by other means, to compensate for the decrease in entropy associated with the disappearance of the thermal energy and its entropy content. Otherwise, only a part of thermal energy may be converted to other kinds of energy (and thus, useful work), since the remainder of the heat must be reserved to be transferred to a thermal reservoir at a lower temperature, in such a way that the increase in Entropy for this process more than compensates for the entropy decrease associated with transformation of the rest of the heat into other types of energy...... Examples Transformation of kinetic energy of charged particles to electric energy [ edit]In order to make the energy transformation more efficient, it is desirable to avoid the thermal conversion. For example, the efficiency of nuclear energy reactors, where kinetic energy of nuclei is first converted to thermal energy and then to electric energy, lies around 35%. [1] [2] By direct conversion of kinetic energy to electric, i.e. by eliminating the thermal energy transformation, the efficiency of energy transformation process can be dramatically improved. [3]History of energy transformation from the early universe [ edit]Energy transformations in the universe over time are (generally) characterized by various kinds of energy which has been available since the Big Bang, later being \"\"released\"\" (that is, transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available to do it. Release of energy from gravitational potential: A direct transformation of energy occurs when hydrogen produced in the big bang collects into structures such as planets, in a process during which part of the gravitational potential is to be converted directly into heat. In Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune, for example, such heat from continued collapse of the planets\\' large gas atmospheres continues to drive most of the planets\\' weather systems, with atmospheric bands, winds, and powerful storms which are only partly powered by sunlight, however, on Uranus, little of this process occurs. On Earth a significant portion of heat output from interior of the planet, estimated at a third to half of the total, is caused by slow collapse of planetary materials to a smaller size, with output of gravitationally driven heat. Release of energy from radioactive potential: Familiar examples of other such processes transforming energy from the Big Bang include nuclear decay, in which energy is released which was originally \"\"stored\"\" in heavy isotopes, such as uranium and thorium. This energy was stored at the time of these elements\\' nucleosynthesis, a process which ultimately uses the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of type IIa supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. Such energy locked into uranium is triggered for sudden-release in nuclear fission bombs, and similar stored energies in atomic nuclei are released spontaneously, during most types of radioactive decay. In such processes, heat from decay of these atoms of radioisotope in the core of the Earth is transformed immediately to heat. This heat in turn may lift mountains, via plate tectonics and orogenesis. This slow lifting of terrain thus represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the heat energy. The stored potential energy may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a kind of mechanical potential energy which has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy which has been stored as potential energy in the Earth\\'s gravitational field, or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, the energy represented by these events had been stored in heavy atoms (or in the gravitational potential of the Earth). The energy stored in heat atoms had been stored as potential ever since the time that gravitational potentials transforming energy in the collapse of long-destroyed stars (supernovae) created these atoms, and in doing so, stored the energy within. Release of energy from hydrogen fusion potential: In other similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This resulted in hydrogen representing a store of potential energy which can be released by nuclear fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) snow-avalanches, or when water evaporates from oceans and is deposited high above sea level (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena on Earth. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by green plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. Release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action. Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of ways over time between releases, as more active energy. In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy, including heat. Examples [ edit]Examples of sets of energy conversions in machines [ edit]For instance, a coal -fired power plant involves these energy transformations: Chemical energy in the coal converted to thermal energy in the exhaust gases of combustion. Thermal energy of the exhaust gases converted into thermal energy of steam through the heat exchanger. Thermal energy of steam converted to mechanical energy in the turbine. Mechanical energy of the turbine converted to electrical energy by the generator, which is the ultimate output In such a system, the first and fourth step are highly efficient, but the second and third steps are less efficient. The most efficient gas-fired electrical power stations can achieve 50% conversion efficiency. Oil- and coal-fired stations achieve less. In a conventional automobile, these energy transformations are involved: Chemical energy in the fuel converted to kinetic energy of expanding gas via combustion Kinetic energy of expanding gas converted to linear piston movement Linear piston movement converted to rotary crankshaft movement Rotary crankshaft movement passed into transmission assembly Rotary movement passed out of transmission assembly Rotary movement passed through differential Rotary movement passed out of differential to drive wheels Rotary movement of drive wheels converted to linear motion of the vehicle. Other energy conversions [ edit]There are many different machines and transducers that convert one energy form into another.

      "{'body': '\"This article is about the scalar physical quantity. For other uses, see Energy (disambiguation). Lightning is the electric breakdown of air by strong electric fields and is a flow of energy. The electric potential energy in the atmosphere changes into heat, light and sound which are other forms of energy. In physics, energy (from the Greek ἐνέργεια - energeia, \"\"activity, operation\"\", from ἐνεργός - energos, \"\"active, working\"\" [1]) is a scalar physical quantity that describes the amount of work that can be performed by a force, an attribute of objects and systems that is subject to a conservation law. Eight different forms of energy exist to explain all known natural phenomena. These forms include (but are not limited to) kinetic, potential, thermal, gravitational, sound, light, elastic, and electromagnetic energy. The forms of energy are often named after a related force. Any form of energy can be transformed into another form, but the total energy always remains the same. This principle, the conservation of energy, was first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any isolated system. According to Noether\\'s theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time. [2]Although the total energy of a system does not change with time, its value may depend on the frame of reference. For example, a seated passenger in a moving airplane has zero kinetic energy relative to the airplane, but non-zero kinetic energy relative to the Earth . Contents [ show]History Edit Main article: History of energy The word energy derives from Greek ἐνέργεια ( energeia ), which appears for the first time in the work Nicomachean Ethics [3] of Aristotle in the 4th century BC. In 1021 AD, the Arabian physicist, Alhazen, in the Book of Optics, held light rays to be streams of minute energy particles, stating that \"\"the smallest parts of light\"\" retain \"\"only properties that can be treated by geometry and verified by experiment \"\" and that \"\"they lack all sensible qualities except energy.\"\" [4] In 1121, Al-Khazini, in The Book of the Balance of Wisdom, proposed that the gravitational potential energy of a body varies depending on its distance from the centre of the Earth. [5]The concept of energy emerged out of the idea of vis viva, which Leibniz defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total vis viva was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz claimed that heat consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter — a view shared by Isaac Newton, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. In 1807, Thomas Young was the first to use the term \"\"energy\"\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense. [6] Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \"\" kinetic energy \"\" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term \"\" potential energy .\"\" It was argued for some years whether energy was a substance (the caloric) or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum . William Thomson ( Lord Kelvin) amalgamated all of these laws into the laws of thermodynamics, which aided in the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes using the concept of energy by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan . During a 1961 lecture [7] for undergraduate students at the California Institute of Technology, Richard Feynman, a celebrated physics teacher and Nobel Laureate, said this about the concept of energy:“ There is a fact, or if you wish, a law, governing natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law; it is exact, so far we know. The law is called conservation of energy; it states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity, which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number, and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same. ”— The Feynman Lectures on Physics [7]Since 1918 it has been known that the law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy, namely time. That is, energy is conserved because the laws of physics do not distinguish between different moments of time (see Noether\\'s theorem ). Energy in various contexts since the beginning of the universe Edit The concept of energy and its transformations is useful in explaining and predicting most natural phenomena. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often described by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations, since in practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces. The concept of energy is widespread in all sciences. In biology, energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living process. In an individual organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological cell or an organelle of a biological organism. Energy is thus often said to be stored by cells in the structures of molecules of substances such as carbohydrates (including sugars) and lipids, which release energy when reacted with oxygen. In human terms, the human equivalent (H-e) (Human energy conversion) The human equivalent energy indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human metabolism, assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500k J per day and a basal metabolic rate of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 ÷ 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds\\' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts--many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum. [8] The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a “feel” for the use of a given amount of energy [9]In geology, continental drift, mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes are phenomena that can be explained in terms of energy transformations in the Earth\\'s interior. [10] While meteorological phenomena like wind, rain, hail, snow, lightning, tornadoes and hurricanes, are all a result of energy transformations brought about by solar energy on the planet Earth. In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma ray bursts are the universe\\'s highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc. ), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). Energy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy which has been available since the Big Bang, later being \"\"released\"\" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy), when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released which was originally \"\"stored\"\" in heavy isotopes (such as uranium and thorium ), by nucleosynthesis, a process which ultimately uses the gravitational potential energy released from the gravitational collapse of supernovae, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear fission bombs. In a slower process, heat from nuclear decay of these atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat, which in turn may lift mountains, via orogenesis. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the heat energy, which may be released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store which has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy which has been stored as potential energy in the Earth\\'s gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks; but prior to this, represents energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed stars created these atoms. In another similar chain of transformations beginning at the dawn of the universe, nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy which can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight. Such sunlight from our Sun may again be stored as gravitational potential energy after it strikes the Earth, as (for example) water evaporates from oceans and is deposited upon mountains (where, after being released at a hydroelectric dam, it can be used to drive turbine/generators to produce electricity). Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement. Sunlight is also captured by plants as chemical potential energy, when carbon dioxide and water are converted into a combustible combination of carbohydrates, lipids, and oxygen. Release of this energy as heat and light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire; or it may be available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and catabolism is triggered by enzyme action. Through all of these transformation chains, potential energy stored at the time of the Big Bang is later released by intermediate events, sometimes being stored in a number of ways over time between releases, as more active energy. In all these events, one kind of energy is converted to other types of energy, including heat. Regarding applications of the concept of energy Edit Energy is subject to a strict global conservation law; that is, whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant. [11]The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified in various ways. For example, it is sometimes convenient to distinguish potential energy (which is a function of coordinates only) from kinetic energy (which is a function of coordinate time derivatives only). It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, electric energy, thermal energy, and other forms. These classifications overlap; for instance thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy. The transfer of energy can take various forms; familiar examples include work, heat flow, and advection, as discussed below . The word \"\"energy\"\" is also used outside of physics in many ways, which can lead to ambiguity and inconsistency. The vernacular terminology is not consistent with technical terminology. For example, the important public-service announcement, \"\"Please conserve energy\"\" uses vernacular notions of \"\"conservation\"\" and \"\"energy\"\" which make sense in their own context but are utterly incompatible with the technical notions of \"\"conservation\"\" and \"\"energy\"\" (such as are used in the law of conservation of energy). [12]In classical physics energy is considered a scalar quantity, the canonical conjugate to time. In special relativity energy is also a scalar (although not a Lorentz scalar but a time component of the energy-momentum 4-vector ). [13] In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of space, but not invariant with respect to rotations of space-time (= boosts ). Energy transfer Edit Because energy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved (wherever it can be defined), it is important to remember that by definition of energy the transfer of energy between the \"\"system\"\" and adjacent regions is work. A familiar example is mechanical work. In simple cases this is written as: (1)if there are no other energy-transfer processes involved. Here is the amount of energy transferred, and represents the work done on the system. More generally, the energy transfer can be split into two categories: (2)where represents the heat flow into the system. There are other ways in which an open system can gain or lose energy. In chemical systems, energy can be added to a system by means of adding substances with different chemical potentials, which potentials are then extracted (both of these process are illustrated by fueling an auto, a system which gains in energy thereby, without addition of either work or heat). Winding a clock would be adding energy to a mechanical system. These terms may be added to the above equation, or they can generally be subsumed into a quantity called \"\"energy addition term \"\" which refers to any type of energy carried over the surface of a control volume or system volume. Examples may be seen above, and many others can be imagined (for example, the kinetic energy of a stream of particles entering a system, or energy from a laser beam adds to system energy, without either being either work-done or heat-added, in the classic senses). (3)Where E in this general equation represents other additional advected energy terms not covered by work done on a system, or heat added to it. Energy is also transferred from potential energy () to kinetic energy () and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy can not be created or destroyed, so the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following: The equation can then be simplified further since (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and (half times mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding . Energy and the laws of motion Edit Template: Classical mechanics In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property since it is a conserved quantity . The Hamiltonian Edit The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. [14]The Lagrangian Edit Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph Louis Lagrange. This is even more fundamental than the Hamiltonian, and can be used to derive the equations of motion. It was invented in the context of classical mechanics, but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy minus the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (like systems with friction). Energy and thermodynamics Edit Internal energy Edit Internal energy – the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is related to the molecular structure and the degree of molecular activity and may be viewed as the sum of kinetic and potential energies of the molecules; it comprises the following types of energy: [15]Type Composition of Internal Energy (U)Sensible energythe portion of the internal energy of a system associated with kinetic energies (molecular translation, rotation, and vibration; electron translation and spin; and nuclear spin) of the molecules. Latent energy the internal energy associated with the phase of a system. Chemical energy the internal energy associated with the different kinds of aggregation of atoms in matter . Nuclear energy the tremendous amount of energy associated with the strong bonds within the nucleus of the atom itself. Energy interactionsthose types of energies not stored in the system (e.g. heat transfer, mass transfer, and work ), but which are recognized at the system boundary as they cross it, which represent gains or losses by a system during a process. Thermal energy the sum of sensible and latent forms of internal energy. The laws of thermodynamics Edit According to the second law of thermodynamics, work can be totally converted into heat, but not vice versa. This is a mathematical consequence of statistical mechanics. The first law of thermodynamics simply asserts that energy is conserved, [16] and that heat is included as a form of energy transfer. A commonly-used corollary of the first law is that for a \"\"system\"\" subject only to pressure forces and heat transfer (e.g. a cylinder-full of gas), the differential change in energy of the system (with a gain in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given by:,where the first term on the right is the heat transfer into the system, defined in terms of temperature T and entropy S (in which entropy increases and the change d S is positive when the system is heated); and the last term on the right hand side is identified as \"\"work\"\" done on the system, where pressure is P and volume V (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d V, is negative when work is done on the system). Although this equation is the standard text-book example of energy conservation in classical thermodynamics, it is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electric, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as advection of any form of energy other than heat, and because it contains a term that depends on temperature. The most general statement of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which temperature is undefinable. Energy is sometimes expressed as:,which is unsatisfactory [12] because there cannot exist any thermodynamic state functions W or Q that are meaningful on the right hand side of this equation, except perhaps in trivial cases. Equipartition of energy Edit The energy of a mechanical harmonic oscillator (a mass on a spring) is alternatively kinetic and potential. At two points in the oscillation cycle it is entirely kinetic, and alternatively at two other points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called equipartition principle - total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom. This principle is vitally important to understanding the behavior of a quantity closely related to energy, called entropy. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a distribution of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (= is given new available energy states which are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between \"\"new\"\" and \"\"old\"\" degrees. This mathematical result is called the second law of thermodynamics . Oscillators, phonons, and photons Edit In an ensemble (connected collection) of unsynchronized oscillators, the average energy is spread equally between kinetic and potential types. In a solid, thermal energy (often referred to loosely as heat content) can be accurately described by an ensemble of thermal phonons that act as mechanical oscillators. In this model, thermal energy is equally kinetic and potential. In an ideal gas, the interaction potential between particles is essentially the delta function which stores no energy: thus, all of the thermal energy is kinetic. Because an electric oscillator ( LC circuit) is analogous to a mechanical oscillator, its energy must be, on average, equally kinetic and potential. It is entirely arbitrary whether the magnetic energy is considered kinetic and the electric energy considered potential, or vice versa. That is, either the inductor is analogous to the mass while the capacitor is analogous to the spring, or vice versa. By extension of the previous line of thought, in free space the electromagnetic field can be considered an ensemble of oscillators, meaning that radiation energy can be considered equally potential and kinetic. This model is useful, for example, when the electromagnetic Lagrangian is of primary interest and is interpreted in terms of potential and kinetic energy. On the other hand, in the key equation, the contribution is called the rest energy, and all other contributions to the energy are called kinetic energy. For a particle that has mass, this implies that the kinetic energy is at speeds much smaller than c, as can be proved by writing √ and expanding the square root to lowest order. By this line of reasoning, the energy of a photon is entirely kinetic, because the photon is massless and has no rest energy. This expression is useful, for example, when the energy-versus-momentum relationship is of primary interest. The two analyses are entirely consistent. The electric and magnetic degrees of freedom in item 1 are transverse to the direction of motion, while the speed in item 2 is along the direction of motion. For non-relativistic particles these two notions of potential versus kinetic energy are numerically equal, so the ambiguity is harmless, but not so for relativistic particles. Work and virtual work Edit Main article: Mechanics Work is force times distance. This says that the work () is equal to the line integral of the force F along a path C; for details see the mechanical work article. Work and thus energy is frame dependent. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball. Quantum mechanics Edit In quantum mechanics energy is defined in terms of the energy operator as a time derivative of the wave function. The Schrödinger equation equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. It thus can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schrödinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of slow changing (non-relativistic) wave function of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an energy level) which results in the concept of quanta. In the solution of the Schrödinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by the Planck equation (where is the Planck\\'s constant and the frequency). In the case of electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or photons . Relativity Edit When calculating kinetic energy (= work to accelerate a mass from zero speed to some finite speed) relativistically - using Lorentz transformations instead of Newtonian mechanics, Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it rest mass energy - energy which every mass must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of body:,wherem is the mass,c is the speed of light in vacuum,E is the rest mass energy. For example, consider electron - positron annihilation, in which the rest mass of individual particles is destroyed, but the inertia equivalent of the system of the two particles (its invariant mass) remains (since all energy is associated with mass), and this inertia and invariant mass is carried off by photons which individually are massless, but as a system retain their mass. This is a reversible process - the inverse process is called pair creation - in which the rest mass of particles is created from energy of two (or more) annihilating photons. In general relativity, the stress-energy tensor serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation. [13]It is not uncommon to hear that energy is \"\"equivalent\"\" to mass. It would be more accurate to state that every energy has inertia and gravity equivalent, and because mass is a form of energy, then mass too has inertia and gravity associated with it. Measurement Edit File: X-ray microcalorimeter diagram.jpg There is no absolute measure of energy, because energy is defined as the work that one system does (or can do) on another. Thus, only of the transition of a system from one state into another can be defined and thus measured. Methods Edit The methods for the measurement of energy often deploy methods for the measurement of still more fundamental concepts of science, namely mass, distance, radiation, temperature, time, electric charge and electric current . Conventionally the technique most often employed is calorimetry, a thermodynamic technique that relies on the measurement of temperature using a thermometer or of intensity of radiation using a bolometer . Units Edit Main article: Units of energy Throughout the history of science, energy has been expressed in several different units such as ergs and calories. At present, the accepted unit of measurement for energy is the SI unit of energy, the joule . Forms of energy Edit File: Hot metalwork.jpg Classical mechanics distinguishes between potential energy, which is a function of the position of an object, and kinetic energy, which is a function of its movement. Both position and movement are relative to a frame of reference, which must be specified: this is often (and originally) an arbitrary fixed point on the surface of the Earth, the terrestrial frame of reference. It has been attempted to categorize all forms of energy as either kinetic or potential: this is not incorrect, but neither is it clear that it is a real simplification, as Feynman points out: These notions of potential and kinetic energy depend on a notion of length scale. For example, one can speak of macroscopic potential and kinetic energy, which do not include thermal potential and kinetic energy. Also what is called chemical potential energy (below) is a macroscopic notion, and closer examination shows that it is really the sum of the potential and kinetic energy on the atomic and subatomic scale. Similar remarks apply to nuclear \"\"potential\"\" energy and most other forms of energy. This dependence on length scale is non-problematic if the various length scales are decoupled, as is often the case ... but confusion can arise when different length scales are coupled, for instance when friction converts macroscopic work into microscopic thermal energy. Examples of the interconversion of energy Mechanical energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Lever Thermal energy Brakes Electric energy Dynamo Electromagnetic radiation Synchrotron Chemical energy Matches Nuclear energy Particle accelerator Potential energy Edit Main article: Potential energy Potential energy, symbols E p, V or Φ, is defined as the work done against a given force (= work of given force with minus sign) in changing the position of an object with respect to a reference position (often taken to be infinite separation). If F is the force and s is the displacement ,with the dot representing the scalar product of the two vectors . The name \"\"potential\"\" energy originally signified the idea that the energy could readily be transferred as work—at least in an idealized system (reversible process, see below). This is not completely true for any real system, but is often a reasonable first approximation in classical mechanics. The general equation above can be simplified in a number of common cases, notably when dealing with gravity or with elastic forces. Gravitational potential energy Edit Main article: Gravitational potential energy The gravitational force near the Earth\\'s surface varies very little with the height, h, and is equal to the mass, m, multiplied by the gravitational acceleration, g = 9.81 m/s². In these cases, the gravitational potential energy is given by A more general expression for the potential energy due to Newtonian gravitation between two bodies of masses m 1 and m 2, useful in astronomy, is,where r is the separation between the two bodies and G is the gravitational constant, 6.6742 (10)×10 −11 m 3 kg −1 s −2. [17] In this case, the reference point is the infinite separation of the two bodies. Elastic potential energy Edit File: Bouncing ball strobe edit.jpg Main article: Elastic potential energy Elastic potential energy is defined as a work needed to compress (or expand) a spring. The force, F, in a spring or any other system which obeys Hooke\\'s law is proportional to the extension or compression, x,where k is the force constant of the particular spring (or system). In this case, the calculated work becomes. Only when k is constant. Hooke\\'s law is a good approximation for behaviour of chemical bonds under normal conditions, i.e. when they are not being broken or formed. Kinetic energy Edit Main article: Kinetic energy Kinetic energy, symbols E k, T or K, is the work required to accelerate an object to a given speed. Indeed, calculating this work one easily obtains the following: At speeds approaching the speed of light, c, this work must be calculated using Lorentz transformations, which results in the following: This equation reduces to the one above it, at small (compared to c) speed. A mathematical by-product of this work (which is immediately seen in the last equation) is that even at rest a mass has the amount of energy equal to: This energy is thus called rest mass energy . Thermal energy Edit Examples of the interconversion of energy Thermal energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Steam turbine Thermal energy Heat exchanger Electric energy Thermocouple Electromagnetic radiation Hot objects Chemical energy Blast furnace Nuclear energy Supernova Main article: Thermal energy Thermal energy (of some media - gas, plasma, solid, etc) is the energy associated with the microscopical random motion of particles constituting the media. For example, in case of monoatomic gas it is just a kinetic energy of motion of atoms of gas as measured in the reference frame of the center of mass of gas. In case of many-atomic gas rotational and vibrational energy is involved. In the case of liquids and solids there is also potential energy (of interaction of atoms) involved, and so on. A heat is defined as a transfer (flow) of thermal energy across certain boundary (for example, from a hot body to cold via the area of their contact. A practical definition for small transfers of heat iswhere C v is the heat capacity of the system. This definition will fail if the system undergoes a phase transition —e.g. if ice is melting to water—as in these cases the system can absorb heat without increasing its temperature. In more complex systems, it is preferable to use the concept of internal energy rather than that of thermal energy (see Chemical energy below ). Despite the theoretical problems, the above definition is useful in the experimental measurement of energy changes. In a wide variety of situations, it is possible to use the energy released by a system to raise the temperature of another object, e.g. a bath of water. It is also possible to measure the amount of electric energy required to raise the temperature of the object by the same amount. The calorie was originally defined as the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by 1 °C (approximately 4.1855 J, although the definition later changed), and the British thermal unit was defined as the energy required to heat one pound of water by 1 °F (later fixed as 1055.06 J). Electric energy Edit Main article: Electromagnetism Examples of the interconversion of energy Electric energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Electric motor Thermal energy Resistor Electric energy Transformer Electromagnetic radiation Light-emitting diode Chemical energy Electrolysis Nuclear energy Synchrotron The electric potential energy of given configuration of charges is defined as the work which must be done against the Coulomb force to rearrange charges from infinite separation to this configuration (or the work done by the Coulomb force separating the charges from this configuration to infinity). For two point-like charges Q 1 and Q 2 at a distance r this work, and hence electric potential energy is equal to:where ε 0 is the electric constant of a vacuum, 10 7 /4π c 0 ² or 8.854188…×10 −12 F/m. [17] If the charge is accumulated in a capacitor (of capacitance C ), the reference configuration is usually selected not to be infinite separation of charges, but vice versa - charges at an extremely close proximity to each other (so there is zero net charge on each plate of a capacitor). The justification for this choice is purely practical - it is easier to measure both voltage difference and magnitude of charges on a capacitor plates not versus infinite separation of charges but rather versus discharged capacitor where charges return to close proximity to each other (electrons and ions recombine making the plates neutral). In this case the work and thus the electric potential energy becomes If an electric current passes through a resistor, electric energy is converted to heat; if the current passes through an electric appliance, some of the electric energy will be converted into other forms of energy (although some will always be lost as heat). The amount of electric energy due to an electric current can be expressed in a number of different ways:where U is the electric potential difference (in volts ), Q is the charge (in coulombs ), I is the current (in amperes ), t is the time for which the current flows (in seconds), P is the power (in watts) and R is the electric resistance (in ohms ). The last of these expressions is important in the practical measurement of energy, as potential difference, resistance and time can all be measured with considerable accuracy. Magnetic energy Edit There is no fundamental difference between magnetic energy and electric energy: the two phenomena are related by Maxwell\\'s equations. The potential energy of a magnet of magnetic moment m in a magnetic field B is defined as the work of magnetic force (actually of magnetic torque) on re-alignment of the vector of the magnetic dipole moment, and is equal:while the energy stored in a inductor (of inductance L) when current I is passing via it is. This second expression forms the basis for superconducting magnetic energy storage . Electromagnetic fields Edit Examples of the interconversion of energy Electromagnetic radiation is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Solar sail Thermal energy Solar collector Electric energy Solar cell Electromagnetic radiation Non-linear optics Chemical energy Photosynthesis Nuclear energy Mössbauer spectroscopy Calculating work needed to create an electric or magnetic field in unit volume (say, in a capacitor or an inductor) results in the electric and magnetic fields energy densities:and,in SI units. Electromagnetic radiation, such as microwaves, visible light or gamma rays, represents a flow of electromagnetic energy. Applying the above expressions to magnetic and electric components of electromagnetic field both the volumetric density and the flow of energy in e/m field can be calculated. The resulting Poynting vector, which is expressed asin SI units, gives the density of the flow of energy and its direction. The energy of electromagnetic radiation is quantized (has discrete energy levels ). The spacing between these levels is equal towhere h is the Planck constant, 6.6260693 (11)×10 −34 Js, [17] and ν is the frequency of the radiation. This quantity of electromagnetic energy is usually called a photon. The photons which make up visible light have energies of 270–520 y J, equivalent to 160–310 k J/mol, the strength of weaker chemical bonds . Chemical energy Edit Main article: Chemical thermodynamics Examples of the interconversion of energy Chemical energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Muscle Thermal energy Fire Electric energy Fuel cell Electromagnetic radiation Glowworms Chemical energy Chemical reaction Chemical energy is the energy due to associations of atoms in molecules and various other kinds of aggregates of matter. It may be defined as a work done by electric forces during re-arrangement of mutual positions of electric charges, electrons and protons, in the process of aggregation. So, basically it is electrostatic potential energy of electric charges. If the chemical energy of a system decreases during a chemical reaction, the difference is transferred to the surroundings in some form (often heat or light ); on the other hand if the chemical energy of a system increases as a result of a chemical reaction - the difference then is supplied by the surroundings (usually again in form of heat or light ). For example,when two hydrogen atoms react to form a dihydrogen molecule, the chemical energy decreases by 724 z J (the bond energy of the H–H bond);when the electron is completely removed from a hydrogen atom, forming a hydrogen ion (in the gas phase), the chemical energy increases by 2.18 a J (the ionization energy of hydrogen). It is common to quote the changes in chemical energy for one mole of the substance in question: typical values for the change in molar chemical energy during a chemical reaction range from tens to hundreds of kilojoules per mole. The chemical energy as defined above is also referred to by chemists as the internal energy, U: technically, this is measured by keeping the volume of the system constant. However, most practical chemistry is performed at constant pressure and, if the volume changes during the reaction (e.g. a gas is given off), a correction must be applied to take account of the work done by or on the atmosphere to obtain the enthalpy, H :Δ H = Δ U + p Δ VA second correction, for the change in entropy, S, must also be performed to determine whether a chemical reaction will take place or not, giving the Gibbs free energy, G :Δ G = Δ H − T Δ SThese corrections are sometimes negligible, but often not (especially in reactions involving gases). Since the industrial revolution, the burning of coal, oil, natural gas or products derived from them has been a socially significant transformation of chemical energy into other forms of energy. the energy \"\"consumption\"\" (one should really speak of \"\"energy transformation\"\") of a society or country is often quoted in reference to the average energy released by the combustion of these fossil fuels :1 tonne of coal equivalent (TCE) = 29 GJ1 tonne of oil equivalent (TOE) = 41.87 GJOn the same basis, a tank-full of gasoline (45 litres, 12 gallons) is equivalent to about 1.6 GJ of chemical energy. Another chemically-based unit of measurement for energy is the \"\"tonne of TNT \"\", taken as 4.184 GJ. Hence, burning a tonne of oil releases about ten times as much energy as the explosion of one tonne of TNT: fortunately, the energy is usually released in a slower, more controlled manner. Simple examples of storage of chemical energy are batteries and food. When food is digested and metabolized (often with oxygen), chemical energy is released, which can in turn be transformed into heat, or by muscles into kinetic energy. Nuclear energy Edit Main article: Nuclear binding energy Examples of the interconversion of energy Nuclear binding energy is convertedinto by Mechanical energy Alpha radiation Thermal energy Sun Electrical energy Beta radiation Electromagnetic radiation Gamma radiation Chemical energy Radioactive decay Nuclear energy Nuclear isomerism Nuclear potential energy, along with electric potential energy, provides the energy released from nuclear fission and nuclear fusion processes. The result of both these processes are nuclei in which the more-optimal size of the nucleus allows the nuclear force (which is opposed by the electromagnetic force) to bind nuclear particles more tightly together than before the reaction. The Weak nuclear force (different from the strong force) provides the potential energy for certain kinds of radioactive decay, such as beta decay. The energy released in nuclear processes is so large that the relativistic change in mass (after the energy has been removed) can be as much as several parts per thousand. Nuclear particles ( nucleons) like protons and neutrons are not destroyed (law of conservation of baryon number) in fission and fusion processes. A few lighter particles may be created or destroyed (example: beta minus and beta plus decay, or electron capture decay), but these minor processes are not important to the immediate energy release in fission and fusion. Rather, fission and fusion release energy when collections of baryons become more tightly bound, and it is the energy associated with a fraction of the mass of the nucleons (but not the whole particles) which appears as the heat and electromagnetic radiation generated by nuclear reactions. This heat and radiation retains the \"\"missing\"\" mass, but the mass is missing only because it escapes in the form of heat and light, which retain the mass and conduct it out of the system where it is not measured. The energy from the Sun, also called solar energy, is an example of this form of energy conversion. In the Sun, the process of hydrogen fusion converts about 4 million metric tons of solar matter per second into light, which is radiated into space, but during this process, the number of total protons and neutrons in the sun does not change. In this system, the light itself retains the inertial equivalent of this mass, and indeed the mass itself (as a system), which represents 4 million tons per second of electromagnetic radiation, moving into space. Each of the helium nuclei which are formed in the process are less massive than the four protons from they were formed, but (to a good approximation), no particles or atoms are destroyed in the process of turning the sun\\'s nuclear potential energy into light. Surface energy Edit If there is any kind of tension in a surface, such as a stretched sheet of rubber or material interfaces, it is possible to define surface energy. In particular, any meeting of dissimilar materials that don\\'t mix will result in some kind of surface tension, if there is freedom for the surfaces to move then, as seen in capillary surfaces for example, the minimum energy will as usual be sought. A minimal surface, for example, represents the smallest possible energy that a surface can have if its energy is proportional to the area of the surface. For this reason, (open) soap films of small size are minimal surfaces (small size reduces gravity effects, and openness prevents pressure from building up. Note that a bubble is a minimum energy surface but not a minimal surface by definition). Transformations of energy Edit Main article: Energy conversion One form of energy can often be readily transformed into another with the help of a device- for instance, a battery, from chemical energy to electric energy; a dam: gravitational potential energy to kinetic energy of moving water (and the blades of a turbine) and ultimately to electric energy through an electric generator. Similarly, in the case of a chemical explosion, chemical potential energy is transformed to kinetic energy and thermal energy in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a pendulum. At its highest points the kinetic energy is zero and the gravitational potential energy is at maximum. At its lowest point the kinetic energy is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of potential energy. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no friction, the conversion of energy between these processes is perfect, and the pendulum will continue swinging forever. Energy can be converted into matter and vice versa. The formula E = mc ², derived by Albert Einstein (1905) quantifies the relationship between mass and rest energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by J. J. Thomson (1881), Henri Poincaré (1900), Friedrich Hasenöhrl (1904) and others (see Mass-energy equivalence#History for further information). Since is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of ordinary amount of mass (say, 1 kg) to other forms of energy can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~ Joules), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of a unit of energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy from most systems is difficult to measure by weight, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of energy transformation into matter (particles) are found in high energy nuclear physics . In nature, transformations of energy can be fundamentally classed into two kinds: those that are thermodynamically reversible, and those that are thermodynamically irreversible. A reversible process in thermodynamics is one in which no energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, however, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible exitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomization in a crystal). As the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic heat death of the universe. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do produce work through a heat engine, or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less. Law of conservation of energy Edit Main article: Conservation of energy Energy is subject to the law of conservation of energy. According to this law, energy can neither be created (produced) nor destroyed by itself. It can only be transformed. Most kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception) [18] are also subject to strict local conservation laws, as well. In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space. There is also a global law of conservation of energy, stating that the total energy of the universe cannot change; this is a corollary of the local law, but not vice versa. [7] [12] Conservation of energy is the mathematical consequence of translational symmetry of time (that is, the indistinguishability of time intervals taken at different time) [19] - see Noether\\'s theorem . According to energy conservation law the total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. This law is a fundamental principle of physics. It follows from the translational symmetry of time, a property of most phenomena below the cosmic scale that makes them independent of their locations on the time coordinate. Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is canonical conjugate to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured. In quantum mechanics energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian operator. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is bywhich is similar in form to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since H and t are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics). In particle physics, this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of virtual particles which carry momentum, exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known fundamental forces (more accurately known as fundamental interactions ). Virtual photons (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical energy state of photons) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between electric charges (which results in Coulomb law ), for spontaneous radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the Casimir force, for van der Waals bond forces and some other observable phenomena. Energy and life Edit Main article: Bioenergetics File: Energy and life.png Any living organism relies on an external source of energy—radiation from the Sun in the case of green plants; chemical energy in some form in the case of animals—to be able to grow and reproduce. The daily 1500–2000 Calories (6–8 MJ) recommended for a human adult are taken as a combination of oxygen and food molecules, the latter mostly carbohydrates and fats, of which glucose (C 6 H 12 O 6) and stearin (C 57 H 110 O 6) are convenient examples. The food molecules are oxidised to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria C 6 H 12 O 6 + 6O 2 → 6CO 2 + 6H 2 OC 57 H 110 O 6 + 81.5O 2 → 57CO 2 + 55H 2 Oand some of the energy is used to convert ADP into ATPADP + HPO 4 2− → ATP + H 2 OThe rest of the chemical energy in the carbohydrate or fat is converted into heat: the ATP is used as a sort of \"\"energy currency\"\", and some of the chemical energy it contains when split and reacted with water, is used for other metabolism (at each stage of a metabolic pathway, some chemical energy is converted into heat). Only a tiny fraction of the original chemical energy is used for work: [20]gain in kinetic energy of a sprinter during a 100 m race: 4 k Jgain in gravitational potential energy of a 150 kg weight lifted through 2 metres: 3k JDaily food intake of a normal adult: 6–8 MJIt would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical energy or radiation), and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies. However, in growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\"\"the surroundings\"\"). [21] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, [22] i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat. Energy and Information Society Edit Modern society continues to rely largely on fossil fuels to preserve economic growth and today\\'s standard of living. However, for the first time, physical limits of the Earth are met in our encounter with finite resources of oil and natural gas and its impact of greenhouse gas emissions onto the global climate. Never before has accurate accounting of our energy dependency been more pertinent to developing public policies for a sustainable development of our society, both in the industrial world and the emerging economies. At present, much emphasis is put on the introduction of a world-wide cap-and-trade system, to limit global emissions in greenhouse gases by balancing regional differences on a financial basis. In the near future, society may be permeated at all levels with information systems for direct feedback on energy usage, as fossil fuels continue to be used privately and for manufacturing and transportation services. Information in today\\'s society, focused on knowledge, news and entertainment, is expected to extend to energy usage in real-time. A collective medium for energy information may arise, serving to balance our individual and global energy dependence on fossil fuels. Yet, this development is not without restrictions, notably privacy issues. Recently, the Dutch Senate rejected a proposed law for mandatory national introduction of smart metering, in part, on the basis of privacy concerns [23] .

In fact, benign (noncancerous) bone tumors are more common than malignant ones. Both malignant and benign bone tumors may grow and compress healthy bone tissue, but benign tumors do not spread, do not destroy bone tissue, and are rarely a threat to life. Malignant tumors that begin in bone tissue are called primary bone cancer. Cancer that metastasizes (spreads) to the bones from other parts of the body, such as the breast, lung, or prostate, is called metastatic cancer, and is named for the organ or tissue in which it began. Primary bone cancer is far less common than cancer that spreads to the bones. Are there different types of primary bone cancer? Yes. Cancer can begin in any type of bone tissue. Bones are made up of osteoid (hard or compact), cartilaginous (tough, flexible), and fibrous (threadlike) tissue, as well as elements of bone marrow (soft, spongy tissue in the center of most bones). Common types of primary bone cancer include: • Osteosarcoma, which arises from osteoid tissue in the bone. This tumor occurs most often in the knee and upper arm (1). • Chondrosarcoma, which begins in cartilaginous tissue. Cartilage pads the ends of bones and lines the joints. Chondrosarcoma occurs most often in the pelvis (located between the hip bones), upper leg, and shoulder. Sometimes a chondrosarcoma contains cancerous bone cells. In that case, doctors classify the tumor as an osteosarcoma. • The Ewing Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFTs), which usually occur in bone but may also arise in soft tissue (muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, blood vessels, or other supporting tissue). Scientists think that ESFTs arise from elements of primitive nerve tissue in the bone or soft tissue (2). ESFTs occur most commonly along the backbone and pelvis and in the legs and arms (3). Other types of cancer that arise in soft tissue are called soft tissue sarcomas. They are not bone cancer and are not described in this resource. (More information about these types of cancer is available in the NCI fact sheet Soft Tissue Sarcomas: Questions and Answers at http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/soft-tissue-sarcoma on the Internet.) What are the possible causes of bone cancer? Although bone cancer does not have a clearly defined cause, researchers have identified several factors that increase the likelihood of developing these tumors. Osteosarcoma occurs more frequently in people who have had high-dose external radiation therapy or treatment with certain anticancer drugs; children seem to be particularly susceptible. A small number of bone cancers are due to heredity. For example, children who have had hereditary retinoblastoma (an uncommon cancer of the eye) are at a higher risk of developing osteosarcoma, particularly if they are treated with radiation. Additionally, people who have hereditary defects of bones and people with metal implants, which doctors sometimes use to repair fractures, are more likely to develop osteosarcoma (4). Ewing sarcoma is not strongly associated with any heredity cancer syndromes, congenital childhood diseases, or previous radiation exposure (2). How often does bone cancer occur? Primary bone cancer is rare. It accounts for much less than 1 percent of all cancers. About 2,300 new cases of primary bone cancer are diagnosed in the United States each year (5). Different types of bone cancer are more likely to occur in certain populations: • Osteosarcoma occurs most commonly between ages 10 and 19. However, people over age 40 who have other conditions, such as Paget disease (a benign condition characterized by abnormal development of new bone cells), are at increased risk of developing this cancer. • Chondrosarcoma occurs mainly in older adults (over age 40). The risk increases with advancing age. This disease rarely occurs in children and adolescents. • ESFTs occur most often in children and adolescents under 19 years of age. Boys are affected more often than girls. These tumors are extremely rare in African American children. What are the symptoms of bone cancer? Pain is the most common symptom of bone cancer, but not all bone cancers cause pain (1). Persistent or unusual pain or swelling in or near a bone can be caused by cancer or by other conditions. It is important to see a doctor to determine the cause. How is bone cancer diagnosed? To help diagnose bone cancer, the doctor asks about the patient’s personal and family medical history. The doctor also performs a physical examination and may order laboratory and other diagnostic tests. These tests may include (1): • X-rays, which can show the location, size, and shape of a bone tumor. If x-rays suggest that an abnormal area may be cancer, the doctor is likely to recommend special imaging tests. Even if x-rays suggest that an abnormal area is benign,Anonymous · 9 years ago2 0 Comment Is Bone Cancer Curable Source (s):https://shrink.im/a9x SEblea · 2 years ago0 0 Comment Bone Cancer Stages Source (s):https://shrinks.im/a8s HCgamiel · 1 year ago0 0 Comment You need to specify the type of cancer. Most cancers involving bone are cancer cells spread from a primary lung cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer, melanoma, and on and on. In all of those cases the bone involvement makes it stage IV which is not curable. If you are asking about a primary bone cancer such as an osteosarcoma, they can be cured if found early. Far more malignancies in bone are actually metastatic cancers from another primary cancer as above. Only a minority are actual cancers of bone which started in a bone - primary bone cancer. For the best answers, search on this site https://smarturl.im/a DHWx Deborah · 2 years ago0 0 Comment You have not specified the stage. Modern medicine doctors go by symptomatic treatment wherein affected area/part is removed by surgery. Radiation & Chemotherapy is given to kill cells. This may prove to be effective in Stage I. Stage II onwards chances of success with this line of treatment are reduces. In any case, modern medicine doctors never use word \"\"cure\"\", but a word \"\"remission\"\" is used. There is also no established cure in Ayurvedic treatment. However, as Ayurvedic approach is to treat the root cause, one may consider approaching a good Ayurvedic Doctor for treatment. One word of caution should be borne in mind vis-a-vis Ayurvedic or any other line of treatment is never fall pray to tall and false claims made by some of the doctors about discovery of cure for cancer.

I heard that some cancers is worse than others. I heard that blood cancer is one of the worst. Which cancer is most deadly? and how long is the predicted life span when diagnosed?3 following 9 answers Answers Relevance Rating Newest Oldest Best Answer: Impossible to answer this question although you will receive lots of opinions. Here is the reason . . cancer is not one disease but literally over 200 different types . .to further complicate matters cancer is a progressive disease. Which means it begins microscopically and begins to grow. Some types of cancer grow very, very slowly and can grow for thirty years or more . . essentially it is possible for the patient to outlive the cancer. And, than there are other types of cancer that are extremely fast, aggressive and can double in a matter of days, weeks, or months . . . these types do not often have 'common and recognizable names' . . one of the more common is pancreatic cancer. And yet, when they talk about panreatic cancer what is 'worst' about it is that it is almost always found in an advanced or stage IV condition. It isn't necessarily the type of cancer you get that is 'worst' . .it is the stage or the progression of the cancer that is the worst type. Any type of cancer that has reached stage IV has become deadly . . because now it is Metastatic which means that the original tumor is now replicating and sending new malignant (microscopic) cells into the blood stream or lymphatic system. Those metastatic cells travel througout the body (hundreds of them) and can lodge at a distant location and set up a whole new colony of cancer . .that will repeat itself indefinitely . . the new colony will seed, reseed, until the body is filled with cancer. That is the worst type of cancer to get . . Metastatic cancer . . and all cancers can become metastatic. That being said . . some of the worst types of cancer to get would be ones that are aggressive with a high grade of tumor . .these types of cancer are invasive and spread faster than treatment can react. Among the most deadly are sarcoma . .which has few treatment options and has had little research. It is also a disease that afflicts young adults more often than older adults. At the moment if you are a teen or young adult and you get cancer . .you are far more likely to die from your disease than an older adult or a child. So . . it isn't always just the kind of cancer you get . . you need to consider the stage . .and your age group. Most people who die from cancer have metastasis at the time of death. ACS: What is Metastatic Cancer? http://www.cancer.org/docroot/CRI/conten... The worst type of cancer to get . .is the kind you get. Source (s): Experience. My teenage son had possibly the worst type of sarcoma a young person could get . . he was stage IV at diagnosis with multiple large tumors (21 cm) within the abdominal cavity .. no organ or involvment and hundreds of peritoneal implants 'seedings' in the lining of the abdomen. His disease was aggressive and doubled within 28 days. Panda · 10 years ago4 1 Comment Asker's rating Worst Types Of Cancer Source (s):https://shrink.im/a9g XQwoolard · 2 years ago0 0 Comment The worst type of cancer to get is any cancer that has metastized to other parts of the body, because then it becomes extremly difficult to treat. Also cancer's where the tumor is inoperable because of its location in the lungs, spine, or brain are always deadly. Patients with pancreatic cancer are only given a few months to live after diagnoed. Blood Cancers are bad too because everywhere, and all the blood in the body is infected so surgery cannot fix it. Organs begin to shut down because the body attacks them, and many patients die of pnemonia. In response to Girl P, blood cancer patients do have a chance I have ALL a type of leukemia and although I have been close to death more than most, I am now very close to remission!11:11 AM · 10 years ago3 0 Comment It depends... Metastatic disease is of course bad, BUT... many patients with metastatic breast cancer to bone only can live for a decade or more; patients with many metastatic sarcomas and testicular cancer can be cured; many patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with only a few liver spots can be cured with aggressive surgery and chemotherapy. Fast-growing cancers are bad, BUT... the faster growing cancers also frequently are the most sensitive to chemotherapy or radiation. Unfortunately, if you don't eradicate it the first time, there may not be another chance. Leukemia can be bad, BUT... CML is a \"\"poster child\"\" for new molecular therapies (imatinib), and patients expect long survival now. CLL is a chronic, indolent disease usually so to me isn;t the worst. AML and ALL in adults are not good, but certain types have much higher cure rates. I think the worst are pancreas cancer and melanoma; we basically have poor therapy for these diseases. Plus, pancreas is very common and melanoma strikes way too many young people. Have to agree though, \"\"the worst kind... is the kind you get.\"\" God bless, best wishes Source (s): Cancer doczrepmd · 10 years ago7 0 Comment Really any cancer that has been in the body growing for a long time is the worst. It has a bigger chance of spreading to the bones. That is why early detection of any cancer can save a life. It is bad when it gets in the bones. If a cancer is malignant ( which means it can spread), that is bad, because if it is removed it can still grow back. Also, it can spread to another part of the body. Leukemia and lymphoma are blood cancers. They are both survivable. 5. What are the statistics for the survival of leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma? Survival is measured in several ways so it is important to define each measure. The survival statistics are often presented as five-year survival, that is, the percentage of people who survive five years from the date of diagnosis. The five-year survival rates for the blood cancers (for all age groups) are: leukemia 50%; Hodgkin lymphoma 86%; non-Hodgkin lymphoma 64% and myeloma 34%. Leukemia rates by type of disease (for all age groups)are: ALL 65.3%; CLL 74.8%; AML 20.7% and CML is 44.4%. These figures differ for children ages 0-19 and people over 75. Source (s):http://www.leukemia-lymphoma.org/all_faq...april T · 10 years ago2 1 Comment I'd say, the worst are deep organ cancers (lung, liver, pancreatic). They are often very advanced before detection, which makes \"\"cure\"\" or remission much less likely. Those closer to the surface, like melanomas, or lymphomas, are often detected earlier. Those where there is a common and reasonably low-cost screening method (colon, breast, prostate) often see higher cure/remission rates because they are detected earlier. Panda, often high grade/aggressive cancers are MUCH more susceptible to chemotherapy. As chemo often targets rapidly dividing cells, and aggressive tumors represent the fastest dividing cells, high grade cancers can be more responsive to treatment than the slow growers. Of course there are many factors, as some cancers, slow or fast growing, simply don't respond well at all to chemo. My oncologist said several times, the single most important prognostic factor is response to chemo.inverse_mushroom_cloud · 10 years ago1 0 Comment Forget anything you have ever been told about Diabetes.

Like a tumor deep inside the brain might require a surgeon to do too much damage getting it out, or risk breaking up the tumor and causing it to spread in the body (the cancer cells can take up residence in other places, including the wound channel on the way out). With something like lung cancer, the cancer might just be spread in too much delicate tissue (lung tissue is very volumous; they say that you have like a tennis court of area in your lungs), and they wouldn't be able to just cut it out without damaging too much tissue or destroying the organ.permalink embed save [–] sinigang93 [ ] 37 points 2 years ago Another way a cancer could end up in an inoperable state would be if the sheer number of malignancies was too large to make an operation or series of operations feasible.

They break off of the original tumour and enter the blood. Once there they can latch anywhere in the body and as little as a single cell can form an additional tumour. Not every cancer will spread, but any cancer can spread as the cells shred themselves and gene regulation goes out the window.permalink embed save parent [–] evilhamster 10 points 2 years ago One additional bit to mention is that when a cancerous tumor first starts, it is usually (but not always) contained within tissues, etc, and cannot easily spread by entering the bloodstream. However as the cancer grows, it consumes more and more resources leading to a defecit of resources in that region of tissues. The body reacts to this defecit by growing new blood vessels to supply the area with more nutrients and energy, helping the cancer sustain its growth. Initially the blood vessels are small enough that it is hard for any cancerous cells to enter the bloodstream in enough quantity that they cause problems elsewhere in the body. However as the original tumor grows, the new blood vessels get bigger and bigger too, increasing the likelihood that a clump of cancerous cells breaks off and can successfully take up residence in another part of the body. There is a tipping point where this happens, where the cancer can suddenly and dramatically spread itself through the body in clumps of cells big enough to survive the trip, and this is generally what is referred to when people talk about a cancer metastasizing, and if those new cancer sites are numerous enough, that's generally when the cancer is terminal, since the dramatic chemo and radiation therapy needed to combat all those sites would be so destructive to the rest of the body that you're likely to die anyway, just in a lot more pain and discomfort than if you let it run its course. (not an expert, could be wrong)permalink embed save parent [–] x NPi 1 point 2 years ago Another big factor that's typically seen before metastasis is suppression of the patient's immune system.

Sometimes a patient might be too weak to survive the operation, or the operation might have a 100% chance of killing the patient.

Operating on a terminal cancer would likely do little to prolong the patients life at the cost of making their remaining time even more unpleasant/painful as they have to cope with pain and recovery from surgery. As callous as it may seem, there is the consideration of cost to benefit received too. A patient with terminal cancer and their family are probably under considerable emotional duress and stress, a doctor has an ethical duty to make impartial and rational recommendations. It may be necessary to say that further treatment is probably not worth it, rather than letting people under emotional duress destroy their finances and livelihood in the pursuit of what the doctor sees as an unattainable cure. Resources; the time, equipment, and medical personnel necessary to treat cancer are finite. If every person deemed \"\"terminal\"\" were to be given all possible treatment (however unlikely it is to succeed), there might not be enough resources to properly treat non-terminal patients too.permalink embed save parent [–] beamseyeview Oncology | Medical Physics 6 points 2 years ago\"\"inoperable\"\" doesn't mean terminal.

Shouldn't the patient make that call?permalink embed save parent [–] beamseyeview Oncology | Medical Physics 3 points 2 years ago That's an important question. I find that the majority of the time, people that are actually facing these decisions have goals similar to what I've described and choose not to undergo futile treatments. I spend a lot of time informing patients and thinking together with them so we can come to a decision together about the best next steps. If you're asking whether I think people should be offered a complete menu of choices including those which are harmful or futile, my answer is no. I think that's part of my responsibility, presenting options that are right for this case. I am not a surgeon, but I don't know any that would put someone through a procedure that has risks for no benefit. Sometimes in North America there is this culture that patient autonomy is the single overarching ethical principle. There are other issues at play in terms of not offering the \"\"menu\"\". This is pretty clear in terms of the issues we're talking about here. It gets murkier in the CPR vs do not resuscitate discussions.permalink embed save parent [–] blackleaf31 1 point 2 years ago I understand your point of view, but as a patient, I disagree. Who can say how I would actually feel or what decisions I would make in the moment of truth, but my gut tells me that I would rather take the slimiest of slim odds rather than merely wait for the end to silently come. If I am going down, I'd rather do it in a fight.permalink embed save parent [–] beamseyeview Oncology | Medical Physics 1 point 2 years ago That would be important information to know in terms of coming to the best decisions together. Of course that would be considered. I hope you never have to face those choices. But I think we're talking about different things since this is all very vague and not tied to a specific situation. There's a difference between a fighting chance and no chance with a given treatment or procedure.permalink embed save parent [–] little_miss_kaea 2 points 2 years ago Because at the point where you might have operated, the patient may still have quite a good quality of life, which might have been maintained for months or possibly years. If you operate you may kill them or have a very significantly reduced quality of life.permalink embed save parent [–] Zig Rat 1 point 2 years ago Ideally we could say the surgeon doesn't want to kill people on the off chance it might have helped. Hippocratic oath and such. Although I think it's more a case of doing an operation that will most likely kill the patient opens up the hospital and the doctors to a massive amount of financial risk.permalink embed save parent \"\n",

      "Text: How Lung Cancer Starts and How it Spreads Lung cancers normally start to form in the cells that line the bronchi and in parts of the lung such as the bronchioles or alveoli where they are presumed to begin as areas of pre-cancerous changes. These initial changes are thought to occur in the genes of the cells, and may cause them to grow at a faster than normal rate. At this early stage, the cells may look slightly abnormal under a microscope, however, they have not as yet formed a mass or tumor, cannot be seen on an x-ray and do not cause any symptoms. Over time, the pre-cancerous changes in the cells may progress to an actual cancer, which as it develops, makes chemicals that cause new blood vessels to form nearby. The new blood vessels then nourish the cancer cells, allowing them to continue to grow and ultimately to form a tumor large enough to be seen on imaging tests. Eventually, cells from the cancer may break away from the original tumor and spread to other parts of the body. There are three primary ways in which cancer can spread: Through the lymphatic system The most common way for cancer to spread is through the lymphatic system. This process is known as “embolization”. Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped collections of immune system cells that are connected by lymphatic vessels. Lymphatic vessels are similar to small veins, except rather than carrying blood they carry a clear fluid called lymph away from the lungs. Lymph contains excess fluid and waste products from body tissues, as well as immune system cells. Lung cancer cells can enter the lymphatic vessels and start to grow in the lymph nodes around the bronchi and in the mediastinum (the area under the breastbone between the two lungs). Once lung cancer cells have reached the lymph nodes, they are more likely to have spread to other areas of the body as well. The stage of the cancer (how far it has progressed) and decisions on appropriate treatment options are based on whether or not the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. Through blood circulation Cancer can also spread through the bloodstream. In order to spread, cancer cells break off from the primary tumor, and then invade the wall of a blood vessel to gain access to the bloodstream. Tumors almost always spread through the veins rather than the arteries since the walls of the veins are thinner and can be invaded more easily. The cancer cells then follow the pattern of the venous flows, until they get stuck somewhere, usually in a very small blood vessel called a capillary. They then invade the wall of the capillary and migrate into nearby tissue where they begin formation of a secondary tumor . By direct extension Cancer can spread by local invasion, meaning that it intrudes on healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. Although it is not fully understood how tumors spread by direct extension, there are three likely possibilities, but which way is most frequent may be dependent on the type of tumor and where in the body it is located. The first possibility is that as the tumor grows and begins to take up more space, it forces itself through nearby normal tissue. As it continues to grow, it begins to block small blood vessels in the area, causing low blood and oxygen levels which in turn, causes normal tissue to die. This tissue death makes it easier for the tumor to continue to push its way through since tumors often follow the path of least resistance. The second possibility is that many normal blood cells produce chemicals known as enzymes that break down cells and tissue. These normal cells use their enzymes for good, by attacking bacteria and viruses and by clearing damaged cells so that new cells can replace them. It has been found that many tumors contain larger quantities of these enzymes than would be found in normal tissues, therefore it is possible that cancer cells manufacture the enzymes and then use them to break down tissue making it easier for the tumor to cut a pathway through healthy tissue. Thirdly, one thing that differentiates normal cells from cancer cells is that cancer cells appear to have the ability to move more easily, therefore it seems reasonable that cancer can spread through nearby tissue simply by directly moving. Given this, scientists have discovered a substance made by cancer cells that stimulates them to move. Although research is not conclusive at this time, it seems that this substance could play a part in how cancer spreads. Some cancer cells seem to “home in” on certain places, perhaps because of substances on their surfaces that stick to cells in these organs. In other cases, the organ itself may release substances that cause the cancer cells to grow faster.\n",

      "Text: Credit: Flickr / CC BY 2.0Most of the deaths caused by cancer happen after cells break away from the initial tumour and spread to other sites in the body – a process called metastasis. But surviving in a foreign region of the body isn’t easy, even for cancer cells. It’s a bit like having to move house – you have to uproot yourself, breaking any connections you had with your former home and make it through moving day, dealing with packing your possessions and other challenges that present themselves, and finally settling down in your new home. For cancer cells this means making it through the bloodstream to reach their new crib in one piece, and setting up ‘home’ in a new location. Much like moving house, metastasis doesn’t occur at random. It’s a controlled and deliberate process and, crucially, one that could be interrupted, if only we can fully understand it. So researchers around the world are desperately trying to gain insights into how and why cells travel around our bodies – both in the development of cancer, and under ‘normal’ circumstances when cells are expected to move, such as when humans develop in the womb from an embryo into a beautiful, bouncing baby. In June, researchers at University College London made a fascinating finding in frog and fish embryos. They elegantly showed that, as the embryo develops to form the body of the baby animal, its cells seem to play a game of ‘chase’ to get into the correct location. Some media outlets breathlessly reported that scientists had “uncovered what causes cancer to spread”, which is a little far-fetched based on the actual research – as we’ll see. So what does this study really add to our understanding of cancer cells? Does it reveal new hints as to how they move around the body? And where does it fit into the wider context of what’s known about metastasis? And, perhaps more fundamentally, how can studying the movement of cells in embryos help researchers understand metastasis? Embryos and cancer Animals like mammals start life as a single fertilised egg cell, which has to divide over and over again to make enough cells to sculpt the baby animal. And these cells have to organise themselves to create all the different specialised types of cells that make up the animal’s body – skin, hair, gut, blood, brain – the whole lot. But while they’re becoming specialised, the cells in an embryo also have to move around to get into the right place, so that everything is where it should be, with a brain at the front, guts in the middle and so on. These processes of cells dividing, specialising and relocating are subverted in cancer, where cells grow out of control, forget what they’re meant to be doing, and start spreading around the body. In fact, since all of the cells in our body contain the same ‘recipe book’ – the genetic instructions encoded within our DNA – they all contain the basic instructions to divide, develop and disperse. Researchers now know that as they grow and spread, cancer cells ‘reawaken’ many processes that once occurred in the embryo, using many of the same genes and mechanisms. So studying how cells divide and move around in embryos may provide insight into what’s happening in cancer. Follow the van The UCL researchers were studying the development of frog and fish embryos. In particular, they were looking at the way two types of cell interact during this process: placodal cells, which go on to become part of the animals’ sensory organs, and neural crest cells, which ultimately give rise to skin pigment cells called melanocytes. Through a series of experiments detailed in their paper in the journal Nature Cell Biology, the researchers showed that, as placodal cells moved around the developing embryo, they were relentlessly chased by neural crest cells. To use our house-moving analogy, the neural crest cells are a bit like people desperately following the removal van to get to their new home on moving day. The researchers also found that this cellular chase happens because placodal cells (the removal van in our analogy) secrete a chemical called SDF1 that the neural crest cells simply can’t resist. But as soon as the neural crest cells catch the placodal cells, these very quickly run away from the neural crest cells again. Much like if our hapless homeowners were to catch up with their removal van at traffic lights, only to have to chase it again as it speeds off when the lights go green. You can watch some videos of the cells playing chase in the third row down here. The authors called the behaviour they observed in the embryos ‘chase-and-run’. And crucially, the behaviour was co-ordinated by the cells themselves, just by interacting with each other. This is a significant and fascinating discovery from a developmental biologist’s point of view – but how does it relate to cancer? For a start, not all of the cell types used in the study are directly relevant to cancer. Placodal cells, for example, are a type of cell known as an ‘epithelial’ cell. These make up your outer skin layer and line internal organs such as the gut. They generally don’t move around in adults, so studying how they move in an embryo may not reveal much about cancer spread. However, the neural crest cells are much more important, because they form melanocytes. These are the cells that go rogue in malignant melanoma – the most dangerous form of skin cancer which is notorious for spreading aggressively. So far, the researchers have only shown that this “chase and run” phenomenon may take place during development in the womb, so more work needs to be done to find out if it does play a role in metastasis. But if it does, there are big implications. Professor Robert Insall, an expert in cancer cell movement based at our Beatson Research Institute in Glasgow, told us it was an “exciting and important” development, because it suggests that cancer cells themselves might govern where and how they spread, rather than being ‘summoned’ by other body parts. “In cancer it may be that there’s no ‘malign force’ directing movement of the cancer cells to other organs. It may all be organised by the cells themselves, from within,” he said. So finding out if this happens in cancer could be an important step in developing a full understanding of metastasis, to bring us closer to stopping it. What do we know about how cancer cells spread? This research is part of a bigger picture emerging from labs around the world –including those funded by Cancer Research UK – and we’ve previously written about some of their work. For example, our researchers in Glasgow found that a gene called Rac1 is involved in immature skin pigment cells moving around, one of the first steps in the development of melanoma. Another group of our scientists found that cancer cells are shape-shifters, changing their shape so they can wriggle through the tight spaces between other cells and escape into foreign territory. And scientists at our London Research Institute have shown that non-cancerous cells called fibroblasts spread around the body along with cancer cells. In fact, it looks like the fibroblast cells actually lead the invasion, punching holes in surrounding tissues so the tumour cells can follow in their tracks. It’s possible that some or all of these different mechanisms play a role in how cancer spreads – so we urgently need to find out how this complex puzzle fits together. If this new study is indeed a window into how cancers spread, then could SDF1, the chemical that attracts neural crest cells, form a new target for treatments that make the cancer cells stay put, rather than going on the move? This new study adds a vital piece to the puzzle, taking us a step closer to fully understanding metastasis. But there’s a long way to go before we fully comprehend this complex and fatal process.

Those indicators are small stickers that are placed on several points within electronic devices like laptops and smartphones. In case of a defective device, service personnel can check whether the device might have suffered from contact with water. After contact with water, or other liquids, the device is not covered by warranty.

The LCI can also be used to avoid discussions about liability and warranty, if it is triggered. Still there can be reasons for doubt. Longer, but not extreme exposure of a device in a humid environment, can trigger a LCI. In theory water can reach the LCI (s), but still the electronics underneath it are not touched, for instance when a small drop of rain falls into the headphone connector. A user should be able to use a device in normal circumstances. For instance a smartphone is normally used while travelling, quite often outside. It can rain, or start to rain outside. A device should not break down immediately. Still such circumstances could trigger the LCI. So, a liquid contact indicator can be triggered, without pointing to liquids causing a defect. Forgery [ edit]In the simplest form, liquid contact indicators are good for a first lead to the cause of defects. LCIs can be replaced, they are readily available in online electronic stores. But the other interest, use in warranty claims, make them prone to potential misuse. Therefore manufacturers introduced LCIs that are harder to reproduce, even with small holographic details. Placement [ edit]Liquid contact indicators are placed on several places in electronic devices. For example underneath the keyboard in a notebook and on several places on its mainboard. Sometimes the liquid contact indicators are placed in such a way that they can be inspected from the outside. For instance there is a LCI in the headphone connector, the dock connector, and near the SIM-card slot of an Apple i Phone. In a Samsung Galaxy smartphone there is a LCI underneath the battery cover near the battery contacts. References [ edit]Explanation of a Water Damage Indicatorhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht3302\n",

      "Text: Lobular neoplasia is a condition that affects the lobules in the breast. The most common types are called atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Breasts are made up of lobules (milk-producing glands) and ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) which are surrounded by glandular, fibrous and fatty tissue. When lobular neoplasia occurs, there is an increase in the number of cells contained in the lobules, together with a change in their appearance and behaviour. Types of lobular neoplasia The most common forms of lobular neoplasia are:atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) – ‘in situ’ means the changes only occur in the breast lobules and do not affect the surrounding tissue. You may hear ALH and LCIS referred to as ‘classical lobular neoplasia’. Very rarely, LCIS may be made up of larger, more abnormal cells. This is known as pleomorphic LCIS (PLCIS). Who it affects Lobular neoplasia is mostly found in women aged 40–50 who haven’t yet been through the menopause. However, some cases are found in post-menopausal women during routine breast screening, often on their first mammogram (breast x-ray). Lobular neoplasia can be found in men, but this is extremely rare. How lobular neoplasia is diagnosed Most women with lobular neoplasia have no symptoms. It’s usually discovered by chance, either when a breast biopsy is taken for another reason, such as a breast lump, or when calcifications (small spots of calcium) are detected on a mammogram. It’s believed that many cases of lobular neoplasia go undiagnosed and never cause any symptoms. When looked at under a microscope, ALH and LCIS can look very. It’s sometimes difficult to separate the two conditions and in this case it will be described as lobular neoplasia. Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about. Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy. However, if the biopsy shows PLCIS, your doctor may suggest an operation to remove the area because of the higher breast cancer risk with this type of lobular neoplasia. The operation will show if there are any cancer cells in the tissue, and whether all the PLCIS has been removed. Although most women who are diagnosed with lobular neoplasia do not develop breast cancer, your specialist will usually recommend having yearly follow-up mammograms for up to five years. This aims to find any further changes as early as possible. Your specialist will discuss which follow-up is best for you. Sometimes further scans may be recommended, such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, if you have other risk factors for breast cancer such as a significant family history of breast cancer. Rarely, some women choose to have a risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (surgery to remove both breasts), with or without breast reconstruction. This may be because they have a strong family history of breast cancer or they feel they cannot cope with the uncertainty and anxiety of having lobular neoplasia. Research has shown treating women who have lobular neoplasia with tamoxifen (a hormone therapy treatment for breast cancer) can reduce the risk of breast cancer developing. However, any possible benefit of taking tamoxifen needs to be considered against the risks and side effects of this treatment. Your specialist will discuss this with you if this might be an option. What this means for you Finding out that you have lobular neoplasia can leave you feeling a number of different emotions. Fear, shock and anger are all common feelings at this time. Although lobular neoplasia is not breast cancer, you may have times when you feel anxious or negative or concerned about your future risk. There are people who can support you, so don’t be afraid to ask for help. Let other people know how you are feeling, particularly your family and friends. It can also help to discuss your feelings or worries with your specialist team. If you want to talk through your feelings in more depth over a period of time, a professional counsellor might be more appropriate. Your specialist or breast care nurse or your GP (local doctor) will usually be able to arrange this. Last reviewed: November 2016Next planned review begins 2018\n",

Continue Reading Belowyou might like Lobular Carcinoma in Situ LCIS isn’t cancer, but it’s thought to be a sign that breast cancer may develop. With this condition, there are abnormal cells in multiple lobules of the breasts, but these cells rarely spread to other parts of the breast or body. The phrase \"\"in situ\"\" means \"\"in its original place. \"\"Areas of lobular carcinoma in situ are sometimes seen in both breasts. Even though this condition doesn’t spread, it’s important to keep an eye on it. Between 20% to 40% of women with this condition will develop a separate invasive breast cancer -- one that will grow outside its original location -- within the next 15 years. Most of the time, these later cancers begin in the milk ducts, rather than the lobules. How is lobular carcinoma in situ diagnosed? You often won’t have any symptoms with LCIS. Many times, it’s not even found by routine mammograms. Unlike other breast cancers and related conditions, LCIS doesn’t cause lumps. It’s most commonly diagnosed when a biopsy is done for another condition. The biopsy findings for LCIS can be very similar to an actual breast cancer called ductal carcinoma in situ. Because of this, you may want to ask for a second opinion to confirm your diagnosis.1 2 3 View All \"\n",

      "Text:  Lobular carcinoma in situ  Lobular carcinoma \"in situ\" (LCIS) is an incidental microscopic finding with characteristic cellular morphology and multifocal tissue patterns.  The condition is a laboratory diagnosis and refers to unusual cells in the lobules of the breast.  The lobules and acini of the terminal duct-lobular unit (TDLU), the basic functional unit of the breast, may become distorted and undergo expansion due to the abnormal proliferation of cells comprising the structure.  These changes represent a spectrum of atypical epithelial lesions that are broadly referred to as lobular neoplasia (LN).   One subset of LN can be defined as LCIS based on specific cellular traits and tissue changes seen histologically.  These lesions are preceded by atypical lobular hyperplasia and may follow a linear progression to invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), with specific genetic aberrations.  This process coincides with the progression of ductal neoplasia to ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma.  Rarely, terminal ducts may be involved in lobular neoplasia, known as pagetoid spread.   Many do not consider LCIS to be a true case of cancer, but it can indicate an increased risk of future cancer.  In 2018, the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) removed LCIS from tumor staging and considers it a benign entity.   Section::::Causes.   Section::::Causes.:Genetics. \n",

      "Text:  In 1941, a seminal publication by Foote and Stewart introduced the term “Lobular Carcinoma In Situ,” using it to categorize a spectrum of cytologic changes that were precursors to invasive cancer. They described these changes as unrecognizable on gross examination, noninfiltrating, and multifocal, with the cells losing their apical-basal distinction (loss of polarity) and varying in shape but not size.  They further predicted that though still contained within the basement membrane, LCIS can indicate an increased risk of future cancer.  Researchers and physicians currently treat the diagnosis as a precursor lesion and risk factor for subsequent development of breast cancer.   This article has thus far described Classical LCIS, and there are 2 other variants of LCIS:  Pleomorphic LCIS (PLCIS) and Apocrine PLCIS, which may be discussed separately in a separate article.   Unlike ductal carcinoma \"in situ\" (DCIS), LCIS is not associated with calcification, and is typically an incidental finding in a biopsy performed for another reason.  LCIS only accounts for about 15% of the \"in situ\" (ductal or lobular) breast cancers.   Section::::See also.   BULLET::::- Breast cancer  BULLET::::- Carcinoma \"in situ\" \n",

      "Text:  Section::::Diagnosis.:Immunohistochemistry.  Lobular Carcinoma In Situ may mimic low grade Ductal Carcinoma In Situ histologically.  In these scenarios, pathologists may employ immunohistochemical testing to differentiate between entities.  This involves using marked antibodies synthetically developed to bind to target proteins expressed on or inside cells.  Specifically, in LCIS, antibodies targeting the e-cadherin protein (or lack thereof) and p120 catenin proteins are used to differentiate LCIS from DCIS.  Due to the fact that LCIS shows lack of e-cadherin expression on cell membranes and subsequent p120 catenin buildup in the cytoplasm, lesions that show positive membrane immunoreactivity for e-cadherin are diagnosed as DCIS.   Section::::Treatment.   Lobular Carcinoma In-situ is both a risk factor and precursor of invasive carcinoma.  Furthermore, it is a non-obligate precursor.  In other words, LCIS represents a distinct entity in the developmental pathway of cancer that does not guarantee invasive carcinoma.  That being said, the historical approach of radical mastectomy (surgical removal of entire breast and axillary lymph nodes) has been substituted by more conservative approaches.  Observation is the preferred management option if LCIS is found to occur alone without accompanying infiltrating or invasive carcinoma. \n",

      "Text: Lobular neoplasia is a condition that affects the lobules in the breast. The most common types are called atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Breasts are made up of lobules (milk-producing glands) and ducts (tubes that carry milk to the nipple) which are surrounded by glandular, fibrous and fatty tissue. When lobular neoplasia occurs, there is an increase in the number of cells contained in the lobules, together with a change in their appearance and behaviour. Types of lobular neoplasia The most common forms of lobular neoplasia are:atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH)lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) – ‘in situ’ means the changes only occur in the breast lobules and do not affect the surrounding tissue. You may hear ALH and LCIS referred to as ‘classical lobular neoplasia’. Very rarely, LCIS may be made up of larger, more abnormal cells. This is known as pleomorphic LCIS (PLCIS). Who it affects Lobular neoplasia is mostly found in women aged 40–50 who haven’t yet been through the menopause. However, some cases are found in post-menopausal women during routine breast screening, often on their first mammogram (breast x-ray). Lobular neoplasia can be found in men, but this is extremely rare. How lobular neoplasia is diagnosed Most women with lobular neoplasia have no symptoms. It’s usually discovered by chance, either when a breast biopsy is taken for another reason, such as a breast lump, or when calcifications (small spots of calcium) are detected on a mammogram. It’s believed that many cases of lobular neoplasia go undiagnosed and never cause any symptoms. When looked at under a microscope, ALH and LCIS can look very. It’s sometimes difficult to separate the two conditions and in this case it will be described as lobular neoplasia. Future breast cancer risk The vast majority of women diagnosed with ALH or LCIS will never get breast cancer. However, people diagnosed with either condition have a slightly higher risk than the general population of developing breast cancer. PLCIS behaves differently to ALH and LCIS, and may be more likely to develop into cancer in the future. Your individual risk depends on several factors, which your specialist can talk to you about. Treatment and follow-up There is no standard recommended treatment or follow-up for lobular neoplasia. Your specialist will discuss treatment options with you based on your particular situation. If your lobular neoplasia is diagnosed by a core biopsy, your doctor may recommend removing more tissue from the area where the lobular neoplasia was found. This is to find out if there are any cancer cells in this area. This may be done using a procedure called a vacuum assisted biopsy, or a small operation known as an excision biopsy. However, if the biopsy shows PLCIS, your doctor may suggest an operation to remove the area because of the higher breast cancer risk with this type of lobular neoplasia. The operation will show if there are any cancer cells in the tissue, and whether all the PLCIS has been removed. Although most women who are diagnosed with lobular neoplasia do not develop breast cancer, your specialist will usually recommend having yearly follow-up mammograms for up to five years. This aims to find any further changes as early as possible. Your specialist will discuss which follow-up is best for you. Sometimes further scans may be recommended, such as an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, if you have other risk factors for breast cancer such as a significant family history of breast cancer. Rarely, some women choose to have a risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy (surgery to remove both breasts), with or without breast reconstruction. This may be because they have a strong family history of breast cancer or they feel they cannot cope with the uncertainty and anxiety of having lobular neoplasia. Research has shown treating women who have lobular neoplasia with tamoxifen (a hormone therapy treatment for breast cancer) can reduce the risk of breast cancer developing. However, any possible benefit of taking tamoxifen needs to be considered against the risks and side effects of this treatment. Your specialist will discuss this with you if this might be an option. What this means for you Finding out that you have lobular neoplasia can leave you feeling a number of different emotions. Fear, shock and anger are all common feelings at this time. Although lobular neoplasia is not breast cancer, you may have times when you feel anxious or negative or concerned about your future risk. There are people who can support you, so don’t be afraid to ask for help. Let other people know how you are feeling, particularly your family and friends. It can also help to discuss your feelings or worries with your specialist team. If you want to talk through your feelings in more depth over a period of time, a professional counsellor might be more appropriate. Your specialist or breast care nurse or your GP (local doctor) will usually be able to arrange this. Last reviewed: November 2016Next planned review begins 2018\n",

      "Text: LCIS may be treated with close clinical follow-up (frequent scheduled checkups) and mammographic screening, tamoxifen or related hormone controlling drugs to reduce the risk of developing cancer, or, if patients and providers would like a less conservative option, bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Some surgeons consider bilateral prophylactic mastectomy to be overly aggressive treatment except for certain high-risk cases.  This is in part due to the fact that multiple studies have shown no significant different in mortality due to breast cancer between women who underwent surveillance and those who elected for the mastectomy.   When Lobular Neoplasia, or specifically, LCIS, is found on core needle biopsy during routine workups, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends the surgeon perform an excisional biopsy of the region to allow pathologists to rule out concurrent DCIS or invasive cancer.  It has been widely reported in the literature that 10-30% of patients with a diagnosis of LCIS on core needle biopsy will receive an upstaged diagnosis after excisional.  If LCIS remains the only diagnosis after the excisional biopsy, NCCN guidelines recommend clinical follow-up every 6–12 months with annual diagnostic mammograms.   Section::::Prognosis.   Lobular neoplasia is considered pre-cancerous, and LCIS is an indicator (marker) for increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer in women. \n",

      "Text: Like the cells of atypical lobular hyperplasia and invasive lobular carcinoma, the abnormal cells of LCIS consist of small cells with oval or round nuclei and small nucleoli detached from each other. Mucin-containing signet-ring cells are commonly seen.  LCIS generally leaves the underlying architecture intact and recognisable as lobules.  Estrogen and progesterone receptors are present and HER2/neu overexpression is absent in most cases of LCIS.  Cell borders are indistinct and neither mitotic activity or necrosis are seen.  In addition, in situ and invasive lesions exhibit loss of cellular adhesion, considered a characteristic histologic feature, due to the fact that e-cadherin expression is lost (transmembrane protein involved in epithelial cell adhesion).  ALH and LCIS are cytologically indistinguishable, so a quantitative threshold is used to classify lesions into either category.  A diagnosis of LCIS requires more than half of the acini in an involved lobular unit to be filled with LN cells and the central lumen of the acini should not be visible.  Proliferation of LN cells that do not meet these histological characteristics are either Atypical Lobular Hyperplasia or simply lobular distension.  Small degrees of cytologic variation can be observed and subsequent subtypes have been described.  However, these subtypes have not been shown to be of clinical usefulness and does not have bearing on whether or not LCIS will progress to full invasive carcinoma. \n",

The condition is a laboratory diagnosis and refers to unusual cells in the lobules of the breast.

A distinctive subset of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is oligometastatic disease, which is characterized by single or few detectable metastatic lesions. The existing treatment guidelines for patients with localized MBC include surgery, radiotherapy, and regional chemotherapy. The European School of Oncology-Metastatic Breast Cancer Task Force addressed the management of these patients in its first consensus recommendations published in 2007. The Task Force endorsed the possibility of a more aggressive and multidisciplinary approach for patients with oligometastatic disease, stressing also the need for clinical trials in this patient population. At the sixth European Breast Cancer Conference, held in Berlin in March 2008, the second public session on MBC guidelines addressed the controversial issue of whether MBC can be cured. In this commentary, we summarize the discussion and related recommendations regarding the available therapeutic options that are possibly associated with cure in these patients. In particular, data on local (surgery and radiotherapy) and chemotherapy options are discussed. Large retrospective series show an association between surgical removal of the primary tumor or of lung metastases and improved long-term outcome in patients with oligometastatic disease. In the absence of data from prospective randomized studies, removal of the primary tumor or isolated metastatic lesions may be an attractive therapeutic strategy in this subset of patients, offering rapid disease control and potential for survival benefit. Some improvement in outcome may also be achieved with optimization of systemic therapies, possibly in combination with optimal local treatment.

I guess it also depends on what your definition of a cure is. I remember when I was first diagnosed as a stage 2, twelve years ago. None of my doctors promised anything like a cure-- they were all very honest about how sneaky BC is, and how it can return even after many, many years (I was 34 at diagnosis). One told me that the only time he would ever use the word \"\"cure\"\" for invasive breast cancer was if the patient died in a skiing accident, at age 80+. LOL. So, is a 30 year survival being \"\"cured\"\"? Or is it dying of something non-cancer and non-treatment related? MJ '98 Stage 2 ER+/PR-/Her-, AC+Tam: Sep 08 bone/liver mets.

My wife was recently diagnosed in March 2010 at age 46 with recurrence of her breast cancer, for which she had a complete mastectomy in Jan 2002 with no nodal involvement. With respect to the recurrence, there were two detectable tumors upon a thorough imaging workup: one 2cm tumor in the upper lobe of her right lung, and a single tumor <1cm on the posterior of her lower spine (only impacting the bone, and in a very accessible position). Cleveland Clinic surgeons completely removed both the spinal tumor (April, laminectomy) and the lung tumor (May, lobectomy). Microscopic levels of involvement of two lymph nodes within the resected portion of the lung were also determined after surgery, presumably spread from the lung tumor (as opposed to indicating a pathway to the lung tumor) since no lymph nodes outside the lung were found to contain cancer on biopsy. She was declared NED as of the completion of her surgeries, with a clean CT scan and pathologically negative surgical margins. The lung tumor was triple positive, like her original cancer, but the spinal tumor was extensively necrotic (i.e. dead) and could not be accurately typed since it had too few living cancer cells left in it. She is currently on a 12 week regimen of Taxol+Herceptin, to be followed later by more Herceptin + Tamoxifen. She is tolerating the Taxol very well, with hair loss and mild fatigue being the only noticable symptoms through the first 6 weeks. Her case is an example of aggressive local treatment of oligorecurrence (or oligometastasis), followed by appropriate systemic treatment for her cancer type. We'll see what the future holds, and of course we hope she's among those that achieve \"\"cure\"\" (or at least holding the cancer at bay for many years) for oligorecurrence.

My onc looks at me like I am crazy when I bring this up, and I have been, regularly, since the fall of 2009 when I first started trolling the web for journal articles which seemed to explain what was going on after my grim prognosis, IDC Er+Pr-Her2+, liver mets, at dx.

I think she believes that I believe in the power of positive thinking, but no, not really, I believe in scientific progress. Time to give her some more literature. And re-raise the issue of when to stop Herceptin. Maybe, we should start a Oligiometastic Group. It would not be exclusive, others can post there, if they want to.

One incision was not healing properly so 2 weeks after BMX I had a 2nd surgery.

Regardless of what I wanted, he went with the full implant (800cc) My original cancer was in the right side. I had a lumpectomy in 2009 and radiation on that side. That was the side they worried about during the reconstruction. That side has healed great. Still looks like I am hiding a watermelon under my arm on that side. My left side is not healing and your problem sounds a whole lot like mine. I have put the ointment and gauze pads until I have bought out Wal-Mart twice...still no improvement. I had additional surgery Feb. 21st and dead tissue was removed and re-stutured... The stitches were too tight and the skin tore away from the site and now I have an open wound with muscle showing....but he says it will heal.

I had necrosis on both sides...had the incision areas revised two weeks after bmx and nearly had to have it done again. I had skin sparing bmx and it was explained to me that there is a lot of trauma that occurs to this skin as surgeons try to remove as much tissue as possible...so sometimes the damage is too much to get normal healing. It took quite a while, but eventually they did heal. Beverly Sue, I too, had an area that stayed open a good while. But, like your surgeon told you, it eventually closes together. I doubted that was possible, but mine actually healed and closed even though I was being expanded every week. Am now scheduled for exchange 3/16, but will probably have to cancel because hubby has to be out of town for work. Was sure looking forward to some soft ta tas, though.

It blistered, peeled, and got ugly and seemed to stay that way for so long that I got pretty discouraged. What worked for me was to take vitamin C and really slow myself down - I was pushing myself too hard and expecting too much, too soon. I spent as much time as possible in a loose fitting cotton shirt to allow good air circulation and also kept everything nice and clean. The healing happened from the inside out, so vitamins, plenty of sleep and rest, a healthy diet, and as little stress and worry as possible. I can't remember how long till before my first fill, but quite a bit later than anticipated. I had my last fill today and will have my DIEP on Mar. 22nd. I do have a dark and pinkish scar - almost 'nipple-ish' - mine ended up being kind of a triangle shape, but the scarred area will be removed at the time of my DIEP. You definitely want to wait until your skin is healthy before proceeding with fill. I think my anxiety about my non-healing scar added to the problem - I felt like I had someone failed . . crazy, I know, but that was the way my mind worked. I had to give myself permission to heal at my own pace while doing everything reasonable to promote healing. I'm 54 - don't know if age is a factor or not.

I had necrosis, which was removed in another operation on 10/06, then had to have a deflated TE replaced on 12/06. There definitely were some \"\"bumps in the road\"\" with this surgery; I had hoped to get the implants replaced much sooner than January of this year. After each surgery, my PS told me I could exercise gently, which meant I could walk at a pace of 2.5 miles/hour, for roughly two - four weeks afterwords. It just depends on how long it takes you to heal before you can really start exercising again.

When I got home I carried items practically one at a time into the house. (also good.) But what I didn't think about was pushing the grocery cart! (Not good.) My chest hurt when I got home and I realized I should not be pushing anything at all heavy like that. So if DH can't go to the market (and he does but he doesn't like it), I may start having my groceries delivered. My sister just set that up for my Mom (my mother no longer drives and is dependent on me to take her shopping) and it is working out great for her. Why didn't I think of setting that up for myself?

He was right because once he removed the TE it was fine and healed very well. I have a TE on the other side (cancer side) and I never had a problem with it. The incision under the breast fold healed with no problem on the bad side it was only the skin on the front of the breast below the nipple. He is not worried about replacing the TE once I am done with chemo because he will not be doing anything with that healed skin on the breast proper. He will go back through the intramammary fold incision. The nature of skin sparing/nipple sparing asks your skin to re-establish blood supply with the muscle and it just didn't happen with the left one. Happens in about 20% of those cases. By the time he replaces the left TE and I begin fills the old will have been out for 5 months so that skin is strong now and the blood supply is great.

My drains have been under 30 cc's for 5 or 6 days now (right is averaging about 24 and left about 26) so I asked about having the drains out at my follow-up this Thursday (exactly 2 weeks after surgery). Turns out the PS, not the BS, is in charge of deciding when the drains come out and he won't even discuss taking them out until our next appointment on 6/7, and he said he still might not take them out then -- that some of his patients have drains for a month or more and the risks of leaving them in outweigh the risk of taking them out too early. Really?! Has anyone heard of leaving drains in for so long?! I'm so frustrated right now I could cry.

I'm having reconstruction with tissue expanders (now in place and filled just to 80-100 ccs). I didn't realize about the link between seroma and lymphodema. I'm sorry that happened to you, hymil. I'm OK with anything as long as I a) expect it and have some time to prepare, and b) know WHY. I think what's so frustrating about this doc is that, although very good and sensitive in other ways, he's all \"\"because I said so\"\" on the subject with no explanation on why he deviates from the standard protocol. With no reasons given, it starts to feel arbitrary and a little cruel. I'll try to give him the benefit of the doubt and remember this will all be in the rearview mirror soon.

Mantra ONJoined: Aug 2009Posts: 936Log in to post a reply May 31, 2011 04:36PM - edited May 31, 2011 04:38PM by Mantra My drains were removed by the nurse who did my home care. The PS had ordered them removed when my output was either under 30 or under 20 per side per day (can't remember) for two consecutive days. Only my first two days were above 25, then dropped to around 18 and then very quickly dropped to barely anything. I guess different places handle things differently but I didn't have to wait for a doctor to remove my drains. Although, IMO, at 20-24 per day, you might want to leave them in longer. The more fluid that drains, the better. I don't think I'd be comfortable removing them yet at 20/24 even though it's been a couple of weeks. I have no idea why some people have large outputs for weeks post op while others like myself have barely any drainage after the first few days. I remember when the homecare nurse said she would be removing them I tried to convince her to leave them in for a few days because I was afraid I might end up with lymphedema. She said she had to follow the PS orders and they were coming out the next day. So that night I kept squeezing and squishing the area trying to ensure all that should be drained, was in fact drained. Stupid move. I started bleeding from the drain site . . . lots and lots of bleeding. DH called an ambulance (we live in a very small town and since they rarely get called they were quite happy to come over to take a peek). They changed the bandages, spent an hour with me to make sure the bleeding had stopped and then spent another 30 minutes privately talking to DH asking him how he was doing, how he was handling being the caregiver, and how he was handling things emotionally. We were both moved by their thoughtfulness.

You want to try and keep the skin from fusing to the drain tube. Otherwise, those drains are doing what you want - getting that fluid out and not creating swelling inside which could lead to infection.

The standard of medical practice is to share with patients why decisions are being made and if options are available to share in the decision making.

I did a lot of googling when my drain was in, and couldn't find anything conclusive about whether prolonged drain use is good or bad.

My surgeons always let me shower as soon as I came home from the hospital even with drains in, fortunately. I just tied a shoelace around my neck and threaded that plastic loop on the top of the drain through the shoelace. The surgeons said not to soap and water the drain sites and incisions directly, but if soap and water ran over those areas during my shower that was OK. And I was to pat the area dry gently. I used antibacterial soap during that time, and had no problems with infections. It's like heaven to finally be free when they take those drains out, isn't it?

Invasive cancer means the cancer cells have broken out of the lobule where they began and have the potential to spread to the lymph nodes and other areas of the body. Invasive lobular carcinoma makes up a small portion of all breast cancers. The most common type of breast cancer begins in the breast ducts (invasive ductal carcinoma). Invasive lobular carcinoma typically doesn't form a lump, which is common in breast cancer. Instead, there is a change in the breast that feels like a thickening or fullness in one part of the breast and is different from the surrounding breast tissue. Symptoms At its earliest stages, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause no signs and symptoms. As it grows larger, invasive lobular carcinoma may cause: An area of thickening in part of the breast A new area of fullness or swelling in the breast A change in the texture or appearance of the skin over the breast, such as dimpling or thickening A newly inverted nipple Invasive lobular carcinoma is less likely than other forms of breast cancer to cause a firm or distinct breast lump. When to see a doctor Make an appointment with your doctor if you have any signs or symptoms that worry you. Your doctor will perform an examination and determine whether you need a diagnostic mammogram or a breast ultrasound. Ask your doctor when to begin screening tests for breast cancer to help detect cancer early and before you may have any signs or symptoms. Routine screening tests may include a physical exam and a breast X-ray (mammogram). Various organizations differ on their screening recommendations, but many suggest women with an average risk of breast cancer consider beginning yearly mammograms in their 40s. If you have a family history of breast cancer or other factors that increase your risk of breast cancer, your doctor may recommend beginning screening mammograms or other tests at an earlier age. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic Causes It's not clear what causes invasive lobular carcinoma. How invasive lobular carcinoma forms Doctors know that invasive lobular carcinoma begins when cells in one or more milk-producing glands of the breast develop mutations in their DNA. The mutations lead to the inability to control cell growth, which results in the cells dividing and growing rapidly. Depending on the aggressiveness of the cancer type, the cancer cells can spread to other parts of the body. Lobular carcinoma cells tend to invade surrounding breast tissue in a starlike manner. The affected area may have a different feel from the surrounding breast tissue, more like a thickening and fullness, but it's unlikely to feel like a lump. Risk factors Factors that may increase your risk of invasive lobular carcinoma include: Being female. Women are more likely to develop breast cancer, but men also can develop breast cancer. Older age. Your risk of breast cancer increases as you age. Women with invasive lobular carcinoma tend to be a few years older than women diagnosed with other types of breast cancer. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). If you've been diagnosed with LCIS — abnormal cells confined within breast lobules — your risk of developing invasive cancer in either breast is increased. LCIS isn't cancer, but is an indication of increased risk of breast cancer of any type. Postmenopausal hormone use. Use of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone during and after menopause has been shown to increase the risk of invasive lobular carcinoma. Researchers believe the hormones may stimulate tumor growth and also make tumors more difficult to see on mammograms. It's not clear whether newer hormone regimens, including lower dose combinations, could also increase the risk of invasive lobular carcinoma. Inherited genetic cancer syndromes. Women with a rare inherited condition called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome have an increased risk of both stomach (gastric) cancer and invasive lobular carcinoma. Women with certain inherited genes may have an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Prevention To reduce your risk of breast cancer, consider trying to: Discuss the benefits and risks of hormone therapy with your doctor. Combination hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer. Talk with your doctor about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy. Some women experience bothersome signs and symptoms during menopause and, for these women, the increased risk of breast cancer may be acceptable in order to relieve menopause signs and symptoms. To reduce the risk of breast cancer, use the lowest dose of hormone therapy possible for the shortest amount of time. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to less than one drink a day, if you choose to drink. Exercise most days of the week. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your doctor whether exercise is OK and start slowly. Maintain a healthy weight. If your current weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy strategies to accomplish this. Reduce the number of calories you eat each day and slowly increase the amount of exercise. Aim to lose weight slowly — about 1 or 2 pounds a week. If you have a family history of breast cancer or feel you may have an increased risk of breast cancer, discuss this with your health care provider. Preventive medications, surgery and more-frequent screening may be options for women with a high risk of breast cancer.

      "Text:  Lobular carcinoma in situ  Lobular carcinoma \"in situ\" (LCIS) is an incidental microscopic finding with characteristic cellular morphology and multifocal tissue patterns.  The condition is a laboratory diagnosis and refers to unusual cells in the lobules of the breast.  The lobules and acini of the terminal duct-lobular unit (TDLU), the basic functional unit of the breast, may become distorted and undergo expansion due to the abnormal proliferation of cells comprising the structure.  These changes represent a spectrum of atypical epithelial lesions that are broadly referred to as lobular neoplasia (LN).   One subset of LN can be defined as LCIS based on specific cellular traits and tissue changes seen histologically.  These lesions are preceded by atypical lobular hyperplasia and may follow a linear progression to invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), with specific genetic aberrations.  This process coincides with the progression of ductal neoplasia to ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma.  Rarely, terminal ducts may be involved in lobular neoplasia, known as pagetoid spread.   Many do not consider LCIS to be a true case of cancer, but it can indicate an increased risk of future cancer.  In 2018, the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) removed LCIS from tumor staging and considers it a benign entity.   Section::::Causes.   Section::::Causes.:Genetics. \n",

      "Text:  In 1941, a seminal publication by Foote and Stewart introduced the term “Lobular Carcinoma In Situ,” using it to categorize a spectrum of cytologic changes that were precursors to invasive cancer. They described these changes as unrecognizable on gross examination, noninfiltrating, and multifocal, with the cells losing their apical-basal distinction (loss of polarity) and varying in shape but not size.  They further predicted that though still contained within the basement membrane, LCIS can indicate an increased risk of future cancer.  Researchers and physicians currently treat the diagnosis as a precursor lesion and risk factor for subsequent development of breast cancer.   This article has thus far described Classical LCIS, and there are 2 other variants of LCIS:  Pleomorphic LCIS (PLCIS) and Apocrine PLCIS, which may be discussed separately in a separate article.   Unlike ductal carcinoma \"in situ\" (DCIS), LCIS is not associated with calcification, and is typically an incidental finding in a biopsy performed for another reason.  LCIS only accounts for about 15% of the \"in situ\" (ductal or lobular) breast cancers.   Section::::See also.   BULLET::::- Breast cancer  BULLET::::- Carcinoma \"in situ\" \n",

      "Text: “If I had children somewhere frozen, I would wonder what to do: Do you donate them? Do you send them to science?” she said.  Just a few years ago, Foust wouldn’t have been able to consider this problem.  Back then, egg freezing had far lower success rates and was considered experimental by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.  That label was lifted in October, thanks to improved success rates with a new flash-freezing technology known as vitrification.  “It’s been a massive leap forward,” said Frank Chang, a reproductive endocrinologist at Shady Grove Fertility Center.  A growing number of oncologists reject the traditional view that the hormones used to stimulate eggs for retrieval — as well as pregnancy itself — might increase the risk of developing certain cancers.  Today many doctors see both the freezing process and pregnancy as safe after three to five years of tamoxifen, a hormone drug used with breast cancer patients, according to Denduluri.  And although large-scale data are still being collected about recurrence rates after pregnancy, tumor histories are also looked at on a case-by-case basis to see if carrying a baby is safe, according to Denduluri. \n",

She is currently going through eight rounds of chemotherapy.  Knowing that her eggs are frozen brings her comfort.  “I remember seeing a picture in my breast surgeon’s office that has a list of things that cancer cannot do,” she said.  “And I wanted that to include that it couldn’t take a pregnancy away from us.  Even if we never use the eggs or get pregnant on our own, it would be a blessing.  I refer to my frozen eggs as my pocketful of sunshine.” \n",

      "Text: There are also smaller studies showing that pregnancy after a breast cancer diagnosis does not carry a negative outcome as long as a patient waits two to three years after starting treatment with tamoxifen, Denduluri said. For many patients, dealing with infertility treatments amid a cancer diagnosis is an emotional (and sometimes physical) encumbrance.  It is also expensive.  Treatments are viewed as elective and are rarely covered by insurance.  Fertility drugs can cost $6,000 a round or more; egg retrieval and freezing can be another $5,500.  For freezing embryos, the process can run $6,500 and more.  Many fertility centers help cancer patients find help with funding their drugs.  The Livestrong Foundation’s Fertile Hope program has helped close to 4,000 survivors since 2004, said Ashley Koenings, senior navigator for fertility services.  Each month, the program helps about 80 people.  Shady Grove works with Walgreens, which donates drugs to patients whose insurance does not cover them.  Shady Grove also has financial assistance for egg retrieval, depending on a patient’s income level.  But even with financial help, the emotional toll is often severe.  Dealing with fertility issues is a roller coaster ride for anyone, but for cancer patients and survivors, it can feel even more burdensome. \n",
